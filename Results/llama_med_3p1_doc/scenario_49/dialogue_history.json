The absence of infection and the presence of epidermal necrosis and detachment on the skin biopsy are highly indicative of a severe drug reaction. The blood chemistry profile will help to further assess the patient's metabolic state and potential organ involvement, which can be a consequence of severe drug reactions. Here are the results of the Blood Chemistry Profile: TEST RESULTS: - BLOOD CHEMISTRY PROFILE: - Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Slightly elevated AST and ALT levels, indicating mild hepatocellular injury. - Renal Function Tests (RFTs): Normal, with no signs of acute kidney injury. - Electrolytes: Within normal limits, with no significant imbalances. - Other notable findings: Mild elevation in creatine kinase (CK) levels, suggesting possible muscle involvement.
