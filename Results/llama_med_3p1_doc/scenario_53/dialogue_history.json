There is no significant deviation from the norm. - Dynamic Balance: The patient demonstrates a slight increase in sway when performing the \"Heel-to-Toe Walk\" and \"Single-Leg Stand\" tests, indicating mild difficulty with dynamic balance. However, these deviations are not significant enough to indicate a major balance disorder."
