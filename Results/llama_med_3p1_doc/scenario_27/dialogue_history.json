However, based on the provided examination data, I can provide a Physical Therapy Assessment based on the physical examination findings. RESULTS: The patient's shoulder examination reveals tenderness around the shoulder joint without warmth or crepitus. Range of motion is limited, with forward flexion, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation all showing pain, particularly in internal rotation. However, strength testing indicates normal rotator cuff strength. Given this information, a Physical Therapy Assessment would focus on improving range of motion, particularly internal rotation, and addressing pain management strategies to enhance overall shoulder function. A referral to a physical therapist specializing in shoulder rehabilitation would be recommended."

    "text": "Based on the provided examination data, Electromyography (EMG) would be relevant to assess the electrical activity of the muscles, including the rotator cuff muscles, to identify any abnormalities that could be contributing to the patient's shoulder pain and limited range of motion. Given the normal rotator cuff strength on strength testing, an EMG could help further evaluate the muscle function and provide additional information for a comprehensive diagnosis. RESULTS: Electromyography (EMG) - Normal findings. The EMG study demonstrates normal electrical activity of the rotator cuff muscles, with no evidence of denervation or abnormal muscle activation patterns. This suggests that the muscle function of the rotator cuff is intact, and the pain and limited range of motion may be due to other factors such as joint or soft tissue issues."

Based on their history of chronic left shoulder pain without a history of trauma, and the physical examination findings, I'm going to request one more test to further assess the condition.

These tests are commonly used to evaluate for conditions such as tendinitis, bursitis, or even systemic diseases that may present with musculoskeletal symptoms. RESULTS: Blood work - Inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP) - 1.2 mg/L (normal range: < 5.0 mg/L), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) - 12 mm/hr (normal range: 0-22 mm/hr). These results are within normal limits, indicating no significant elevation in inflammatory markers. This suggests that an inflammatory or systemic condition is less likely to be the primary cause of the patient's chronic shoulder pain."
