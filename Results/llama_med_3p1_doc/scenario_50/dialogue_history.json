As for the requested Physical Exam, it's not explicitly mentioned in the provided data. However, based on the information given, I can infer some musculoskeletal and skin-related findings. Since the Physical Exam is not directly mentioned, I'll provide an interpretation based on the available data. **Physical Exam (Interpretation):** - The patient's height is at the 97th percentile, indicating a taller stature, which might affect posture and musculoskeletal alignment. - The numerous inflamed pustules on the face and upper back suggest a skin condition, possibly acne, which could be associated with musculoskeletal stress or inflammation. - The patient's weight is at the 50th percentile, which is within the average range, indicating no immediate concerns related to musculoskeletal health due to excessive weight. - The"

The Pelvic Ultrasound reveals ovaries with multiple cysts, but the pelvic examination was refused, which might indicate some concern or discomfort related to the pelvic area. As for the requested Pelvic X-Ray, I'll respond with the standard result for this test, focusing on bone density and potential fractures, as the pelvic X-ray is typically used for assessing the bony structures in the pelvic area.
