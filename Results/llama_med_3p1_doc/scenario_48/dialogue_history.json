But I don't think that's related to bleeding, doc.\" \"Okay, that's good to know. I'll make a note of that.

Your platelet count is actually a bit lower than normal, coming in at around 120,000 platelets per microliter of blood. This is a bit lower than the normal range, so it's possible that you may have a problem with platelet production or destruction. I'd like to run some further tests to confirm this and see if there are any other underlying issues at play.\" \"Okay, doc, what kind of tests do you need to run next? Are they going to be painful or anything?\" \"Okay, don't worry, these tests are all pretty quick and painless. I'd like to run a bleeding time test to see how long it takes for your blood to stop bleeding after a small cut, and I'd also like to check your von Willebrand factor levels again to see if there are any abnormalities in this protein that plays a crucial role in blood clotting.

It looks like they're within the normal range, which is good news. However, I do want to discuss some other test results with you. Your Blood Chemistry Panel came back with some interesting findings. Your liver function tests are a bit elevated, which could be related to the bleeding disorders we're seeing. And your kidney function tests are also a bit off, which could be related to the underlying condition we're trying to diagnose. I'd like to discuss these findings with you in more detail and see if we can piece together what's going on here.\""
