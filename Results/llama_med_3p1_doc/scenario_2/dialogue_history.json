Based on your symptoms, physical examination findings, and test results, I'm going to take a guess that you have Hirschsprung disease, a congenital condition that affects the development of the nerves in the colon, leading to a functional obstruction. This would explain the abdominal distension, feeding difficulties, and sensation of blockage or resistance when trying to pass stool. The fact that oatmeal seems to help your mom's symptoms, but not yours, might be related to the fact that oatmeal is high in fiber, which can help stimulate bowel movements, but may not be as effective for you due to the underlying nerve dysfunction.
