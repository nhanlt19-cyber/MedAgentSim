BLOOD TEST FOR INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY: The test results are as follows: Zonulin level: 3.5 ng/mL (within normal limits), Lactulose/Mannitol ratio: 0.6 (within normal limits).

Other relevant results remain the same as before. It's worth noting that the combination of normal ultrasound, negative stool culture, normal stool fat test, and negative hydrogen breath test, along with the absence of significant laboratory abnormalities, points towards a functional gastrointestinal disorder such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

These findings suggest that the patient does not have a common food intolerance or sensitivity that could be contributing to their gastrointestinal symptoms.

Based on the ultrasound of the lower abdomen, negative stool culture, normal stool fat test, and negative hydrogen breath test, along with the absence of significant laboratory abnormalities, I'm inclined to believe that the patient is suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The results of the food intolerance panel also support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of common food intolerances or sensitivities. Considering the patient's symptoms, such as chronic diarrhea, lower abdominal discomfort, and changes in bowel movements, I believe that IBS is a likely diagnosis. The fact that the patient's symptoms are not related to any obvious infection, malabsorption, or food intolerance also points towards IBS. However, I would like to request one more thing to confirm my diagnosis. Can you tell me more about the patient's bowel habits when they're not eating trigger foods? Do they find that their symptoms are more manageable or are they still present? This will help me to better understand the patient's condition and make a more informed diagnosis.

I've also been trying to establish a more regular routine with my meals and bowel movements, which has been helpful in reducing some of the unpredictability."
