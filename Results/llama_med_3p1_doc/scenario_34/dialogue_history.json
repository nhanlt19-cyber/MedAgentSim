However, considering the rash's characteristics and potential exposure history, it's crucial to gather more information before proceeding to an invasive procedure like a biopsy. A thorough clinical evaluation, including a detailed history, physical examination, and further non-invasive testing, would be recommended to guide the next steps in management. Therefore, I would not proceed with a Skin Biopsy at this time."
