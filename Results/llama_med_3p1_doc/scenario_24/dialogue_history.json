However, the description of the mass as being non-tender and the presence of a fluid wave positive on palpation, along with the abdominal findings suggestive of ascites, may indicate that the mass is not a simple growth but possibly related to the ascites or another underlying condition. As for the sensation, it's not explicitly described as tender or normal, but rather the focus was on its palpability and the associated findings. The ultrasound results would provide more insight into the characteristics of the mass.

    "speaker": "Measurement",
    "text": "The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that the ascites and the ovarian mass may be contributing to the respiratory distress and discomfort. The sensation of the extra load when lying down could be more pronounced in the abdomen, given the presence of ascites. As for the changes in bowel movements or urination habits, there is no direct mention of these symptoms in the provided information. However, the presence of ascites could potentially affect the patient's urinary habits due to the pressure on the bladder. Regarding the ovarian mass, the ultrasound results confirm its presence and size. It's essential to note that the CA-125 level is normal, which might be helpful in differentiating between types of ovarian masses. The CT scan would provide more detailed information about the mass, the extent of the ascites, and any potential involvement of other abdominal structures. Here are the results of the requested test: RESULTS: CT Scan of the Abdomen - Findings: Large ovarian mass on the right side, significant ascites, and mild splenomegaly. No evidence of metastatic disease."

However, it's essential to assess these factors to understand the overall clinical picture. The liver function tests would provide valuable information about the patient's hepatic function, which could be affected by the ascites, the ovarian mass, or other underlying conditions. Regarding the splenomegaly, the presence of mild splenomegaly on the CT scan could be related to the ascites, liver disease, or other causes. Changes in energy levels or fatigue could be associated with the splenomegaly, but this is speculative without further information. Here are the results of the requested test: RESULTS: Liver Function Tests - All within normal limits. As for the splenomegaly, the patient's overall energy levels or fatigue are not directly related in the provided information, but the presence of mild splenomegaly may still contribute to the patient's overall clinical picture.
