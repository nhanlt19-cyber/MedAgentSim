Pelvic Ultrasound: The findings indicate a normal uterus and adnexa, with no evidence of fibroids or ovarian cysts, which might suggest a regular menstrual cycle without significant abnormalities. However, this does not provide direct information about the menstrual cycle's regularity or changes in bleeding. Hormonal Profile: The FSH, LH, Estradiol, Progesterone, and Testosterone levels are all reported as Normal. This suggests that the patient's hormonal balance is within the expected range for a typical menstrual cycle, but again, it doesn't provide direct information about the menstrual cycle's regularity or changes in bleeding.
