However, since the patient's recent lab results already show a sodium level of 122 mEq/L, which is low, we will focus on that aspect. Given the new symptoms, it's essential to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely. The results for the comprehensive Electrolyte_Labs, focusing on the sodium level, are as follows: Sodium: 122 mEq/L (already reported), however, we will include additional measurements for a complete picture.
