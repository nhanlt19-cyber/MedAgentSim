The ECG tracing also shows some minor T-wave flattening, which may be related to the patient's high heart rate or underlying cardiac condition. Chest X-Ray: No significant abnormalities noted. The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits, and there are no signs of cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, or other significant pulmonary pathology.

Is it noticeable when you look at it, and does it seem to be related to the patent ductus arteriosus or the whooshing noise you've been experiencing? Also, I'd like to summarize what I've learned from our conversation so far. You were born at term with a low birth weight, and your mother didn't receive prenatal care. You've had difficulty latching and frequent spit-up since birth, and you were diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). You've also had episodes of apnea as a baby, and you've been experiencing a constant feeling of being \"off\" when you're sitting still, along with episodes of lightheadedness and syncope. The echocardiogram showed findings consistent with patent ductus arteriosus, and the ECG results showed a slightly elevated heart rate and some minor T-wave flattening. Is there anything else you'd like to add or any questions you have for me?"
