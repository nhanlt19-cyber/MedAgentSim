It's a bit sore to the touch, but it's not as painful as the groin area. As for urination and bowel movements, I haven't noticed anything unusual.

REQUEST TEST: Hip_MRI RESULTS: Hip_MRI - The MRI findings confirm a posterior dislocation of the right hip, with the femoral head displaced out of the acetabulum. There is evidence of a large area of bone edema and necrosis in the femoral head, consistent with avascular necrosis. The surrounding soft tissues show signs of inflammation and injury. The acetabulum and surrounding pelvic structures appear intact, but there is a significant disruption of the hip joint.
