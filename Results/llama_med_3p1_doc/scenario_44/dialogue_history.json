RESULTS: Echocardiogram - The cardiac ultrasound shows a normal left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 58% (within normal range). There are no signs of structural heart disease, valvular abnormalities, or significant pericardial effusion. The right heart chambers appear to be within normal limits, and there are no signs of pulmonary hypertension.

Here are the findings: RESULTS: Sleep Study - Polysomnography (PSG) results indicate that you experience mild obstructive sleep apnea (AHI: 15 events/hour, RDI: 20 events/hour) with a significant increase in respiratory events during REM sleep. Your oxygen saturation levels during sleep are generally within normal limits, but there are episodes of desaturation to 88% during REM sleep. There is no evidence of central sleep apnea or Cheyne-Stokes respiration. The sleep study also reveals that you experience periodic limb movements (PLMs) during sleep, which may be contributing to your disrupted sleep patterns. These findings suggest that your sleep patterns, specifically the obstructive sleep apnea and PLMs, may be contributing to your symptoms of shortness of breath and chest tightness, particularly during periods of increased respiratory effort. Based on the comprehensive evaluation of your symptoms, medical history, physical examination, and test results, including the normal cardiac ultrasound, I am making a diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with associated periodic limb movements (PLMs) and a mixed obstructive-restrictive lung function pattern.
