The fatigue you're experiencing could be related to the liver dysfunction, as indicated by the elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. The slightly elevated leukocyte count from the CBC may also suggest an underlying infection or inflammation that could be contributing to your overall condition, including the fatigue. It's essential to consider these factors when evaluating your symptoms and potential treatments. Please note that the Thyroid Function Tests would provide more specific information about your thyroid function, which could also be a cause of fatigue.
