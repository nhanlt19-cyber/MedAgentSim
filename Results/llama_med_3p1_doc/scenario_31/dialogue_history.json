The Bone Marrow Biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure where I'll insert a small needle into the hip bone to collect a sample of bone marrow tissue.

The procedure is usually done under local anesthesia, and it should not be painful. During the procedure, I'll also be able to examine the bone marrow tissue for any signs of infiltration or abnormal cell growth, which can help confirm the diagnosis of CLL/SLL. Additionally, I may also be able to obtain a bone marrow biopsy sample to check for any genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities that are associated with CLL/SLL. I want to reassure you that this procedure is a common and relatively safe test, and it's an important step in confirming the diagnosis of CLL/SLL. I'll be with you every step of the way to ensure that you're comfortable and informed throughout the process. Now, I'd like to ask one more question to confirm your understanding of the diagnosis.
