The patient reported a history of fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance, with no recent travel or exposure to sick contacts. The patient also mentioned that they have been experiencing shortness of breath, especially during physical activities. Based on the provided medical data: - The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia and tachypnea, which may be related to the cardiovascular and respiratory findings. - The cardiovascular examination revealed a fixed split S2 on inspiration, suggesting a possible congenital heart defect. - The respiratory examination showed increased respiratory effort, which may be a compensatory mechanism for the underlying heart defect. - The abdominal examination revealed mild distension and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), which could be related to right-sided heart failure or liver disease. - The extremities showed mild pitting edema, which could be indicative of fluid overload. - The Echocardiogram confirmed the presence of an atrial septal defect with"
