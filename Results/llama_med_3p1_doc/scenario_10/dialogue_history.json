The polyp is composed of glandular epithelium, with no evidence of malignant transformation. The presence of a stalk-like base and a well-vascularized appearance further supports this diagnosis. Now that we have a confirmed diagnosis, I'd like to discuss the next steps and treatment options with you. As a pedunculated polyp, the risk of malignancy is low, but it's still essential to monitor the polyp for any signs of growth or change. I recommend regular follow-up colonoscopies every 6-12 months to ensure the polyp remains benign. In the meantime, I'd like to discuss the possibility of removing the polyp. This can be done through a procedure called polypectomy, which involves removing the polyp from the rectum. This can help alleviate any discomfort or bleeding associated with the polyp.

After the procedure, you may experience some mild discomfort, similar to a mild cramp, which should resolve on its own within a few hours. You'll also need to follow a low-fiber diet for a few days after the procedure to help the rectal area heal. Additionally, you'll need to follow up with me in about 6-12 months to ensure the polyp doesn't grow back.

If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Now, I think that's all the questions I have for you.
