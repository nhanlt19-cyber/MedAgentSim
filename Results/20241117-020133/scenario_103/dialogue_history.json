The X-ray shows some signs of mild osteochondritis dissecans, which is a condition where a piece of cartilage and bone in the knee joint becomes detached. The MRI shows some inflammation and mild edema in the joint, but no significant structural damage.\n\nThe blood work came back normal, but I did notice some mild elevations in the inflammatory markers, which suggests that the condition is inflammatory in nature.\n\nBased on the findings, I'm going to make a diagnosis."
