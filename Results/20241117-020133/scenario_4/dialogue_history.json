The recent antibiotic treatment for acute sinusitis may have caused an underlying urinary tract infection that led to the formation of a kidney stone.\n\nI also suspect that the patient may have a blood clot, which could be causing the pain and discomfort in the lower back and flank area. This is further supported by the results of the D-dimer test, which indicated signs of clotting or coagulation disorders.\n\nThe patient's recent medical history and family history of kidney stones also support this diagnosis.\n\nI'm going to order further tests to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.\n\nDIAGNOSIS"
