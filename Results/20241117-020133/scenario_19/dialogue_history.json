I think I've gathered enough data to make a diagnosis.\n\nAfter reviewing your test results, I believe the cause of your symptoms is a herniated disc in your L4-L5 disc, which is putting pressure on your nerve root. This is likely causing the pain, numbness, and tingling in your leg.\n\nI also suspect that your job involves repetitive lifting and bending, which may have contributed to the strain on your lower back. Additionally, your stress and anxiety levels have been high lately, which can exacerbate muscle tension and pain.\n\nTo confirm, I'd like to make a few notes on your chart. I'll also schedule a physical therapy session to help you with exercises to alleviate the pain and improve your range of motion.\n\nIn the meantime, I want you to take it easy for the next few days, avoid heavy lifting, and consider using heat or cold therapy to help manage your pain.\n\nDiagnosis Ready: Herniated"
