I'm going to review the test results again and see if I can piece together a diagnosis.\n\nBased on the X-ray results, I notice that there's a noticeable asymmetry in the alignment of your patella, which could indicate a problem with the patellofemoral joint. The ultrasound results show a large, firm lump under the skin, which could be related to a tumor or a cyst. The MRI results suggest that there's inflammation and swelling in the surrounding tissues, which could be indicative of an underlying condition such as osteochondritis dissecans or a patellar tendonitis.\n\nConsidering the family history of similar problems with the knee, I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of Osteochondritis Dissecans. This condition is a type of joint disease that affects the cartilage and bone in the knee joint, often causing pain, swelling, and limited mobility.\n\nHowever, I'd like to confirm this diagnosis by performing one final test.
