However, I also want to consider the possibility of an autoimmune disorder, given the elevated Rheumatoid Factor test result.\n\nConsidering the rash's characteristics and the patient's symptoms, I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of erythema migrans, a common skin manifestation of Lyme disease. This condition typically presents with a distinctive, expanding rash around the site of the tick bite, which is consistent with the patient's history of a tick exposure.\n\nI'm going to request a confirmation test to rule out other possibilities, but I believe the evidence points towards Lyme disease as the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. \n\nDIAG"
