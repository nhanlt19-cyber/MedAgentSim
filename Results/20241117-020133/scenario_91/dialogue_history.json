Based on the information provided, I'm going to make a diagnosis.\n\nAfter considering the patient's history of weakness and decreased sensation in their right arm, as well as the test results, I believe the patient is suffering from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The patient's occupation as a golfer, combined with the slight delay in reflexes and limited range of motion in the right shoulder joint, supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of numbness, tingling, and pain in the right arm, as well as the recent changes in vision, suggest that the compression of the median nerve in the wrist is likely causing these symptoms. The patient's family history of neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, also increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.\n\nI would recommend further treatment to manage the patient's symptoms, including wrist splints, physical therapy, and possibly surgery to relieve pressure on the median nerve."
