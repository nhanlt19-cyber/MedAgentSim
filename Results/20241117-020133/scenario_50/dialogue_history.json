It's caused by the absence of one X chromosome, which affects the development of female reproductive organs.\n\nI know this diagnosis may be concerning, but with proper management and treatment, individuals with Turner syndrome can lead active and fulfilling lives. We can discuss the necessary treatment options, including hormone replacement therapy, to support your growth and development.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about your diagnosis.\""
