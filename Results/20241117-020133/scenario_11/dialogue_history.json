The delayed gag reflex and abnormal EMG results indicate nerve irritation or compression. The slight abnormality in your cardiac conduction on the ECG and the Holter Monitor results suggest a possible cardiac component to your condition.\n\nGiven the combination of these findings, I'm inclined to consider the possibility of a carotid body tumor, which can compress the vagus nerve and cause episodes of unresponsiveness. The tumor can also lead to cardiac conduction abnormalities.\n\nHowever, I'd like to confirm this diagnosis by running further tests. \n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Carotid Body Tumor"
