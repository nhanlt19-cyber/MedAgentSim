You've been experiencing shooting ear pain and difficulty wearing earrings since then, and you've noticed that the pain seems to be related to the earrings.\n\nFrom our conversation, I'm going to take a guess that you might have a condition called Eustachian tube dysfunction. This is a condition where the tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the throat doesn't function properly, leading to pressure and discomfort in the ear.\n\nI'm also thinking that the earrings might be causing irritation or inflammation in the ear canal, which is contributing to your symptoms.\n\nI'd like to confirm"
