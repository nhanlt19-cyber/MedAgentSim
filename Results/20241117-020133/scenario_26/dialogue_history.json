This condition is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, which can cause urinary symptoms such as difficulty starting to urinate, weak urine flow, and frequent urination.\n\nThe ultrasound results show a mildly enlarged prostate gland, which is consistent with BPH. The cystoscopy results also show some bladder irritation, but no visible abnormalities.\n\nI want to reassure you that BPH is a common condition in men of your age group and can often be managed with lifestyle changes and medication.\n\nHowever, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment plan as needed.\n\nIn the meantime, I recommend that"
