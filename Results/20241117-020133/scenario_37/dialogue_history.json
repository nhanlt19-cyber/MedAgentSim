This is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the nerves, leading to muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling in the legs, as well as urinary incontinence and speech difficulties.\n\nThe combination of your progressive muscle weakness, numbness or tingling in your legs, urinary incontinence, speech difficulties, and balance and coordination issues all point towards this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that your symptoms developed gradually over six months also supports this diagnosis.\n\nI'll be ordering a follow-up appointment to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed. In the meantime, I'll provide you with some instructions on how to manage your symptoms and improve your overall quality of life.\n\nPlease note that Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome is a serious condition that requires close monitoring and treatment. I'll be working with you"
