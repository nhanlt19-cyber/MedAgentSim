Regarding lifestyle changes, it's a good idea to avoid straining during bowel movements, as this can exacerbate the prolapsed hemorrhoid. You may also want to consider elevating the head of your bed by about 6 inches to help reduce pressure on your rectum while you sleep. I'd also like to schedule a follow-up appointment with a gastroenterologist to rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms.
