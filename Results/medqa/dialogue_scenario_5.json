    "text": "I've been pretty active lately, I joined a volleyball team about a week ago, and we've been playing a few times a week. I was doing some pivoting and twisting movements during practice yesterday, and I think that might have put some extra stress on my knee, but it didn't really bother me until today."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "We were doing a lot of quick changes of direction, trying to simulate game scenarios. I was also doing some lateral shuffles and rapid pivots, which I guess put a lot of stress on my knee joint."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "The pain seems to be constant, but it's more noticeable when I'm standing or walking, and it feels like it's getting a bit worse throughout the day. I don't really notice any swelling or redness around the knee, but it's a bit tender to the touch, especially on the inside."

    "speaker": "Patient",

I've been told by my doctor that I might be prone to some issues with my joint alignment, but I don't know if that's relevant now."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Can you tell me more about the knee alignment issues you've had in the past? What kind of symptoms were you experiencing, and how did your doctor diagnose them? Also, you mentioned pivoting and twisting movements yesterday - did you notice any sensation or feeling in your knee when you were doing those movements, such as a grinding or snapping sensation?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've had some issues with my knee alignment in the past, but I think it was more of a general feeling of instability, like my knee would sometimes feel like it was going to give way or wobble when I was standing or changing direction. My doctor did some X-rays and an MRI, and they found some issues with my tibia and fibula alignment, but they didn't seem too serious at the time. I just kind of brushed it off as a minor issue and continued with my usual activities. As for the sensation when I was pivoting and twisting yesterday, I wouldn't say I felt anything specific, like a grinding or snapping sensation. It was more of a dull ache, like I mentioned before, but it was also a bit of a... a feeling of wear and tear, like my knee was just getting tired and sore from all the quick changes of direction."
