But in my case, it seems like they're more frequent and persistent, which might be related to my fatigue and weakness. As for my mother's migraines, I've noticed that she does get really sensitive to light and sound when she's having a migraine. She also gets these aura symptoms, like seeing flashing lights or zigzag patterns, before the migraine starts. I'm not sure if there's a connection, but it's possible that there's a genetic component to her migraines and maybe even to my symptoms.
