Doctor [5%]: Can you tell me more about the gait and limb ataxia you're experiencing? When did you first notice these symptoms and have they been getting worse over time?
Patient [5%]: "Actually, it started a few months ago, I'd stumble a bit when I walked, but I thought it was just fatigue. Lately, it's gotten so bad that my friends have commented on how I'm walking funny, like I'm drunk or something. And my right arm's been feeling really weak too, it's hard to hold things or even just lift my arm sometimes."
Doctor [10%]: Have you experienced any numbness or tingling sensations in your arms or legs, and have you noticed any changes in your vision or speech patterns?
Patient [10%]: "Yeah, sometimes my right leg feels numb, like it's asleep or something. And my vision's been a bit blurry lately, especially when I'm tired. But my speech has been fine, no problems there. Oh, and I've also been having trouble with balance, like I'll be standing still and feel like I'm gonna fall over."
Doctor [15%]: Can you tell me more about your medical history? Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
Patient [15%]: "I've been dealing with some stomach issues for a while now. I've had a lot of abdominal pain and diarrhea, and I've lost a lot of weight. I've been seeing a specialist for it, and they've been trying different treatments, but it's been hard to get it under control."
Doctor [20%]: Have you been experiencing any fatigue, fever, or night sweats in addition to the abdominal symptoms you mentioned?
Patient [20%]: "Yeah, I've been feeling really tired all the time, and I've had a low-grade fever on and off for a while now. And night sweats, oh yeah, they're awful. I wake up drenched in sweat, it's disgusting. Sometimes I'll even have fevers at night, which makes it hard to sleep."
Doctor [25%]: Can you tell me more about your stomach issues? What kind of treatments have you been trying, and have they helped at all with your symptoms?
Patient [25%]: "I've been on some strong medications, and I've had to get infusions every few weeks. They've helped a bit, but it feels like we've been playing whack-a-mole - one symptom goes away, and another one pops up. And now with these new problems with my walking and balance, I'm not sure what's going on."
Doctor [30%]: Can you tell me more about the medications you've been taking for your stomach issues? Are they immunosuppressive drugs, and have you experienced any side effects from them?
Patient [30%]: "I've been taking natalizumab for the past year, and before that, I was on some other meds that didn't seem to work as well. The natalizumab has helped a bit with the stomach pain and diarrhea, but I've had some infusion reactions, like headaches and dizziness. And lately, I've been getting these weird sensations in my legs, like they're on fire or something."
Doctor [35%]: "Can you describe these 'on fire' sensations in your legs in more detail? Are they constant, or do they come and go?"
Patient [35%]: "They're not constant, they come and go. Sometimes my legs will feel like they're burning, or like there's a thousand needles poking at them. It's really uncomfortable and it's getting worse. Sometimes it'll happen when I'm walking, and it's hard to even take a step when it's like that."
Doctor [40%]: Have you noticed any rashes or skin lesions on your legs or anywhere else on your body, especially during or after these burning sensations?
Patient [40%]: "No, I haven't noticed any rashes or skin lesions. The burning sensations are really the worst part, they're so uncomfortable. Sometimes I'll get a little numbness too, but it's mostly the burning that's the problem."
Doctor [45%]: Have you experienced any memory or cognitive issues, such as difficulty concentrating or remembering things?
Patient [45%]: "Yeah, actually, I have been having some trouble remembering things lately. I'll be in the middle of a conversation and forget what we were talking about, or I'll forget where I put my stuff. It's really frustrating because I know I'm not that old, but my brain just feels foggy sometimes."
Doctor [50%]: Have you traveled to any new places or been exposed to anyone with similar symptoms recently?
Patient [50%]: "No, I haven't traveled anywhere new recently, and I don't think I've been exposed to anyone with similar symptoms. I've been pretty stuck at home, dealing with my stomach issues and these new problems with my walking and balance."
Doctor [55%]: Can you tell me more about your diet and appetite lately? Have you been experiencing any loss of taste or smell, or difficulty swallowing?
Patient [55%]: "Yeah, to be honest, I've had no appetite lately. I've been trying to eat, but everything tastes like cardboard, and I've been losing weight because of it. And swallowing has been a bit difficult, like my throat is narrowing or something. It's hard to explain, but it feels like I'm not enjoying food as much as I used to."
Doctor [60%]: Have you experienced any difficulty breathing, or have you noticed any changes in your voice, such as hoarseness or tremors?
Patient [60%]: "No, I haven't had any breathing problems, and my voice has been fine, no hoarseness or tremors. It's mostly been my balance, walking, and stomach issues that have been giving me trouble."
Doctor [65%]: Can you tell me more about the weight loss you've experienced? How much weight have you lost and over what period of time?
Patient [65%]: "I've lost around 20 pounds over the past year or so. It's been really gradual, but it's just been a steady decline. I've been trying to eat, but like I said, everything tastes like cardboard, and I just don't have the appetite I used to. It's hard to keep the weight on when you're not enjoying food."
Doctor [70%]: "Have you experienced any difficulty controlling your bladder or bowels, or have you noticed any changes in your urinary habits?"
Patient [70%]: "Actually, yes, I have been having some accidents lately. I'll be walking and suddenly I'll feel like I have to go to the bathroom right away, and sometimes I can't make it in time. It's really embarrassing. And I've also had some diarrhea, which is nothing new with my stomach issues, but it's been worse lately."
Doctor [75%]: "Can you tell me more about your urinary habits? Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort while urinating, and have you noticed any changes in the frequency or volume of your urine?"
Patient [75%]: "Yeah, sometimes it hurts when I pee, like there's a burning sensation. And I've been going to the bathroom a lot more often, especially at night. I'll wake up multiple times to use the bathroom, and it's just exhausting. The volume of my urine is also a lot less than it used to be, like I'm not producing as much as I should be."
Doctor [80%]: REQUEST TEST: Urinalysis
Measurement [80%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [85%]: "Okay, so the urinalysis came back normal. That helps to rule out some possibilities. Can you tell me more about your abdominal pain? Is it constant, or does it come and go? And are there any specific foods or activities that make it worse?"
Patient [85%]: "The abdominal pain is constant, but it varies in intensity. Some days it's a dull ache, and other days it's sharp and stabbing. And yeah, there are specific foods that make it worse - like fatty or greasy foods, or anything spicy. Even just eating a big meal can make it worse. And sometimes if I'm stressed or anxious, it'll get worse too."
Doctor [90%]: "Do you have a family history of any neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease?"
Patient [90%]: "No, I don't think so. My family's had some health issues, but mostly just high blood pressure and diabetes. Nothing neurological that I'm aware of."
Doctor [95%]: Have you experienced any anxiety or depression, or have you noticed any changes in your mood lately?
Patient [95%]: "Yeah, to be honest, I've been feeling really anxious and down lately. It's hard not to when you're dealing with all these physical symptoms. Some days I just feel like I'm stuck in this rut and I don't know how to get out of it. And with my memory issues, it's like my brain is foggy all the time, it's really frustrating."
Doctor [100%]: "Okay, I think I've got a good sense of what's going on. Based on your symptoms and medical history, I'm going to take a stab at a diagnosis. But before I do, I just want to confirm one more thing: have you experienced any muscle weakness or paralysis in your face, arms, or legs?" (Please respond with the patient's answer, and I'll provide the diagnosis)
Patient [100%]: "Actually, yeah, I have been experiencing some muscle weakness in my right arm, like I mentioned earlier. It's hard to lift my arm or hold things, and sometimes my hand will just give out on me. And I've also had some muscle weakness in my legs, especially when I'm walking. It's like my legs are made of jelly or something."
