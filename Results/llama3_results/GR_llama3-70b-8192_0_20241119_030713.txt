Doctor [5%]: "Can you tell me more about this double vision you're experiencing? Is it constant or does it come and go?"
Patient [5%]: "It's mostly when I look at things up close, like when I'm working on my computer or reading a book. Sometimes it's okay, but other times I see two of everything and it gets really frustrating. It's like my eyes can't decide what to focus on."
Doctor [10%]: "Have you noticed any other symptoms in your eyes, such as blurred vision, eye pain, or sensitivity to light?"
Patient [10%]: "No, not really. My eyes don't hurt or anything. It's just this weird doubling thing. But, you know, sometimes my eyelids feel kind of heavy, like they're harder to open than usual."
Doctor [15%]: "Let's talk about the difficulty climbing stairs you mentioned. Is it more of a balance issue or do you feel like your legs are actually weak or tired?"
Patient [15%]: "It's more like my legs feel heavy and tired, like I've been running a marathon or something. And it's not just the stairs, it's even hard to walk sometimes. But, you know, after I sit down for a bit and rest, my legs start to feel better and I can walk around fine again."
Doctor [20%]: "Have you experienced any muscle weakness or fatigue in your arms or hands, aside from the upper limb weakness you mentioned earlier?"
Patient [20%]: "Actually, yeah. Sometimes it takes a lot of effort to even hold my hairbrush or do simple things like brushing my teeth. It's like my arms are really heavy and don't want to move. But, again, after I rest for a bit, it seems to get better."
Doctor [25%]: "Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'after I rest for a bit, it seems to get better'? How long does it take for you to feel better, and does it happen every time you rest?"
Patient [25%]: "Well, it's not like I can pinpoint an exact time, but usually if I take a break for 30 minutes to an hour, I start to feel better. It's like my body just needs a little time-out or something. And yeah, it happens almost every time I rest. It's pretty consistent, actually."
Doctor [30%]: "Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing or speaking? Do you have any trouble with droopy eyelids or facial weakness?"
Patient [30%]: "No, I don't have any trouble swallowing or speaking. And, no, my eyelids are just heavy, like I mentioned before, but they don't droop or anything. My face feels normal, thankfully."
Doctor [35%]: "Let's focus on your upper limb weakness for a moment. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensations in your arms or hands?"
Patient [35%]: "Actually, yes. Sometimes my hands feel a little tingly, like when your foot falls asleep, but it's not all the time. And it's not really painful or anything, it's just... strange. Like, I'll be trying to type on my computer and my fingers will feel a little funny, like they're not totally awake."
Doctor [40%]: "Can you show me exactly what you mean by 'a little funny' with your fingers? Can you demonstrate how they feel when you're trying to type?"
Patient [40%]: "Okay, so like, right now my fingers feel normal, but when it's happening, it's hard to describe... it's like they're not really responding to my brain or something. I'll try to type a sentence, and my fingers will kind of... stutter, I guess. They'll hit the wrong keys or not press down hard enough. It's like they're not getting the signal from my brain to move properly. Does that make sense?"
Doctor [45%]: "Have you noticed any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, especially when you're experiencing these symptoms?"
Patient [45%]: "No, I don't have any trouble breathing or feeling short of breath, even when I'm feeling really weak or tired. It's weird, because I'd expect to feel out of breath when my legs or arms are feeling so heavy, but I don't."
Doctor [50%]: "Have you noticed any changes in your reflexes, such as slow or overactive reflexes, especially in your arms or legs?"
Patient [50%]: "Actually, yeah. Sometimes my reflexes seem really slow, especially in my legs. Like, if I'm trying to walk quickly or react to something, my legs just can't seem to keep up. It's like they're a fraction of a second behind or something. But, at the same time, sometimes my arms will jerk around really quickly when I'm trying to do something simple, like picking up a pen. It's like my nerves are just a little mixed up, you know?"
Doctor [55%]: "Have you experienced any muscle cramps, either at rest or with exercise, particularly in your legs or arms?"
Patient [55%]: "Yeah, I've had a few muscle cramps in my legs, usually after I've been walking or climbing stairs. They're not too bad, but they're definitely noticeable. It's like my muscles are just tightening up on me for a second before they relax again."
Doctor [60%]: "Can you tell me more about your diet and exercise habits? Have you experienced any significant changes in your appetite or weight recently?"
Patient [60%]: " Hmm, diet and exercise... I'd say I'm pretty average, I guess. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a good slice of pizza or a glass of wine every now and then. As for exercise, I don't really do much, to be honest. I have a desk job, so I'm usually sitting for most of the day. But I do try to take short walks during my lunch break or on the weekends. As for my appetite and weight, I think I've lost a few pounds recently, but it's not like I've been trying to diet or anything. I just seem to be less hungry than usual, I suppose."
Doctor [65%]: "Have you experienced any mood changes or feelings of fatigue that aren't just related to your physical symptoms? Do you feel like you're able to concentrate and focus normally?"
Patient [65%]: "Yeah, I'd say I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual, even when I'm not doing anything physical. And, to be honest, my mood's been a bit off lately too. I've been feeling kind of irritable and anxious, which isn't really like me. And, concentration-wise, I've been having a bit of trouble focusing on my work, which is weird because I'm usually really sharp and on top of things. It's like my brain's been foggy or something."
Doctor [70%]: "Can you tell me more about this anxiety and irritability you're experiencing? Is it constant or does it come and go, and are there any specific triggers that make you feel this way?"
Patient [70%]: "Yeah, it's definitely not constant, but it seems to come and go, kind of like my physical symptoms. Sometimes I'll be feeling fine, and then suddenly I'll just feel really anxious or frustrated, like I'm on edge or something. Triggers... hmm, I'm not really sure. Maybe it's just when I'm feeling really tired or my symptoms are acting up. Or maybe it's when I'm trying to do something that requires a lot of concentration, like my graphic design work. When I'm struggling to focus, it can get really frustrating and that can lead to feelings of anxiety, I suppose."
Doctor [75%]: "Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns, such as insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness?"
Patient [75%]: "Yeah, I have been having some trouble sleeping lately. It's like my body is just really restless, even when I'm exhausted. I'll lie awake for hours, feeling all jittery and anxious, and it's hard to fall asleep. And even when I do finally fall asleep, I tend to wake up feeling really groggy and tired, like I haven't slept at all. It's like my body is just not getting the rest it needs, you know?"
Doctor [80%]: "Can you tell me more about this jittery, anxious feeling you experience when you're trying to sleep? Is it accompanied by any physical symptoms, such as a racing heart or tremors?"
Patient [80%]: "Yeah, definitely. My heart will be racing, and I'll feel like I'm on high alert or something. My legs will be restless, and I might even get some muscle twitches. It's like my body is just revved up, and I can't seem to calm it down. And yeah, sometimes I'll get these little tremors in my hands, like they're vibrating or something. It's really annoying, because I just want to relax and fall asleep, but my body won't let me."
Doctor [85%]: "Okay, let's take a closer look at your muscle twitching and tremors. Can you show me what you mean by 'little tremors' in your hands? Can you demonstrate it for me?"
Patient [85%]: "Okay, so... like right now, my hands are feeling pretty normal, but when it happens, it's like... see? *holds out hands and they start to shake slightly* Oh, wait, it's happening right now. It's like my fingers are just vibrating really fast, and I have no control over it. It's really slight, but it's definitely there. *tries to hold a finger still, but it wobbles slightly* See how my finger is doing that? It's like my nerves are just firing off too fast or something."
Doctor [90%]: "Thank you for demonstrating that for me. It's helpful to see the tremors in action. REQUEST TEST: Electromyogram (EMG) to assess muscle activity and potential nerve damage. Also, REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC) to rule out any underlying infections or inflammation that might be contributing to your symptoms."
Measurement [90%]: RESULTS: Electromyography (EMG) - Decreased muscle response with repetitive stimulation.
Doctor [95%]: "With the EMG results showing decreased muscle response with repetitive stimulation, I want to ask: Do you have any family history of neurological disorders, such as myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome?"
Patient [95%]: "No, I don't think so. I mean, my family's pretty healthy, and I'm not aware of anyone having anything like that. My parents are still going strong, and my grandparents lived into their 80s without any major health issues. I've got a few cousins with some minor things, like allergies or asthma, but nothing neurological that I know of."
Doctor [100%]: "Okay, I think I have a good understanding of your symptoms and test results. Based on your double vision, upper limb weakness, and muscle fatigue, as well as the EMG results, I'm going to make a diagnosis. DIAGNOSIS READY: Myasthenia Gravis, a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the nerve-muscle connection, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. I'll discuss treatment options with you and answer any questions you may have."

Correct answer: Myasthenia gravis
Scene 0, The diagnosis was CORRECT (100%)
