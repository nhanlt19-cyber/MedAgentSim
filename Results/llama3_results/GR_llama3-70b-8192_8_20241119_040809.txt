Doctor [5%]: Can you tell me more about the breast mass you're experiencing? How long have you noticed it, and has it changed in size or shape over time?
Patient [5%]: "I first noticed it about four weeks ago, and it's grown quite rapidly since then. It's definitely gotten bigger, but the shape has stayed pretty much the same. It's just...there, you know? This lump that shouldn't be there."
Doctor [10%]: "Has the lump been painful or tender to the touch, and have you noticed any changes in your nipple or areola, such as discharge or inversion?"
Patient [10%]: "No, it doesn't hurt at all. I've poked and prodded at it a bit, and it doesn't seem to be sensitive. And no, my nipple and areola look normal, no discharge or anything unusual. It's just this...lump."
Doctor [15%]: "Have you experienced any trauma to the breast area recently, such as a fall or a blow to the chest? And have you noticed any changes in your menstrual cycle or any other symptoms such as fatigue or weight loss?"
Patient [15%]: "No, no trauma at all. I've been pretty careful, actually. And no changes in my period, either. It's been regular as clockwork. I do feel a bit more tired than usual, but I just figured it was from grading papers and getting ready for parent-teacher conferences. Nothing out of the ordinary."
Doctor [20%]: "Can you tell me more about this fatigue you're experiencing? Is it constant or does it come and go, and have you had any trouble sleeping or feeling rested in the mornings?"
Patient [20%]: "It's just a general feeling of being more exhausted than usual, I suppose. I mean, I've always been a morning person, but lately, I've been hitting the snooze button a few extra times. And even after a full night's sleep, I still feel like I need a nap. But it's not like I'm waking up in the middle of the night or anything, I just...don't feel rested, you know?"
Doctor [25%]: "Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or eating habits recently, or have you lost any weight unintentionally?"
Patient [25%]: "No, actually, my appetite has been pretty normal. I've been eating the same old things, and I haven't noticed any changes in my weight. I've still been fitting into all my clothes just fine."
Doctor [30%]: "Have you had any recent illnesses or infections, such as a cold or flu, or have you been taking any new medications or supplements?"
Patient [30%]: "No, no recent illnesses or infections. I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood! And no new medications or supplements, either. Just my usual multivitamin and some occasional ibuprofen for headaches."
Doctor [35%]: "Have you noticed any changes in your skin, such as rashes or lesions, or have you had any family history of breast cancer or other cancers?"
Patient [35%]: "No, my skin looks normal, no new rashes or lesions. And no, no family history of breast cancer or any other cancers, as far as I know."
Doctor [40%]: "Can you tell me more about your reproductive history? Have you had any children, and if so, did you breastfeed them? And have you had any hormone replacement therapy or birth control-methods in the past?"
Patient [40%]: "I have two kids, a boy and a girl, both in elementary school now. I breastfed them both for about a year each, and I didn't have any issues with that. As for birth control, I've been on the pill for years, but I stopped taking it about five years ago when my husband and I decided we were done having kids. No hormone replacement therapy, though."
Doctor [45%]: "Have you performed any self-examinations on your breasts regularly, and did you notice the lump during one of these self-exams or was it accidental?"
Patient [45%]: "I've been pretty good about doing self-exams, yeah. I try to do them every month or so. And actually, I found the lump by accident. I was getting ready for bed and noticed it while I was washing up. It wasn't during a self-exam or anything, just a random discovery."
Doctor [50%]: "Have you noticed any changes in your breast size or shape, such as swelling or asymmetry, especially during your menstrual cycle?"
Patient [50%]: "No, my breasts have always been pretty standard, you know? Same size, same shape. I don't think I've ever really noticed any changes, even during my period. They're just...normal, I guess."
Doctor [55%]: "Have you had a mammogram or any other breast imaging done in the past, and if so, when was the last time you had one?"
Patient [55%]: "No, I've never had a mammogram or any other breast imaging done before. I've always meant to, but you know how it is - life gets busy, and it just slipped my mind. I've been meaning to schedule one, but then I found this lump and, well...here I am."
Doctor [60%]: "Based on what you've told me, I'd like to do a physical exam of the breast area to get a better feel for the lump. May I proceed?"
Patient [60%]: "Of course, go ahead. I'm a little nervous, but I want to get to the bottom of this. Just be gentle, okay?"
Doctor [65%]: "I'll be gentle, don't worry. Can you lie back and relax, please? I'll examine the breast area and check for any abnormalities."
Patient [65%]: "Okay...do what you need to do. Just remember, gentle, okay?"
Doctor [70%]: "Alright, I'll be gentle. I'm going to palpate the breast area now to get a better feel for the lump. Can you tell me if you feel any tenderness or discomfort as I examine the area?"
Patient [70%]: "No, it doesn't hurt or feel sensitive at all. Just feels...lumpy, I guess. Go ahead and press on it, I can handle it."
Doctor [75%]: "Okay, I'm going to continue the examination. Can you tell me if the lump feels mobile, meaning can I move it around under the skin, or is it fixed to the underlying tissue?"
Patient [75%]: "Hmm, let me think about that. Yeah, I think it feels like it moves a little bit. You can push it around some, but it doesn't feel like it's totally loose or anything. Does that make sense?"
Doctor [80%]: "Okay, that's helpful to know. Now, I'd like to examine the lymph nodes in your underarm area to see if they're enlarged or tender. Can you lift your arm and let me take a look?"
Patient [80%]: "Okay, no problem. Go ahead and take a look. I'm not sure what you're looking for, but I don't think I've noticed anything unusual in that area."
Doctor [85%]: "Alright, I'm going to palpate the lymph nodes in your underarm area. Can you tell me if you feel any tenderness or discomfort as I press on the nodes?"
Patient [85%]: "No, it doesn't feel uncomfortable or tender at all. Just a little pressure, I guess. You're not finding anything weird, are you?"
Doctor [90%]: Can I also examine your axillary area, the space between your arm and chest, to see if there are any abnormalities or enlarged lymph nodes there as well?
Patient [90%]: "Okay, sure. Go ahead and take a look. I'm not sure what you're looking for, but I haven't noticed anything unusual in that area either."
Doctor [95%]: "I'm not finding anything unusual in the axillary area either. Now, I'd like to request a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound of the breast to get a better look at the lump. Would you be okay with that?"
Patient [95%]: "Yeah, that sounds fine. I figure the more information we can get, the better, right? Just tell me what I need to do and when it'll happen. And, um, can you tell me a little bit more about what we might be looking for with those tests?"
Doctor [100%]: "Alright, I'll explain the tests and what we're looking for. But first, based on your symptoms and our examination today, I'm going to go ahead and make a diagnosis. DIAGNOSIS READY: I'm afraid it's likely that you have breast cancer, possibly invasive ductal carcinoma. We'll need to confirm with the mammogram and ultrasound results, but given the rapid growth of the lump and your symptoms, this is my working diagnosis. We'll discuss treatment options once we have the test results."

Correct answer: Phyllodes tumor
Scene 8, The diagnosis was INCORRECT (33%)
