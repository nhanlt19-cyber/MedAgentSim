Doctor [5%]: "Can you tell me more about your baby's symptoms? How old is the baby and when did you first notice something was wrong?"
Patient [5%]: "She's just a few days old, and I didn't really notice anything at first, but when they did the routine checks at the hospital, they heard a weird sound in her heart. They said it's a murmur or something, and that's when they told me something might be wrong."
Doctor [10%]: "Did the hospital staff do any further testing or examinations to try to pinpoint the cause of the murmur, and have you noticed any other symptoms or abnormalities in your baby's behavior or appearance?"
Patient [10%]: "No, not really, they just referred us to this clinic for further evaluation. But I did notice that her eyes look a little cloudy, and there are some small blue spots on her skin that don't go away when I press on them."
Doctor [15%]: "Can you tell me more about these blue spots on her skin? Are they present all over her body or are they localized to a specific area? And have you noticed any other changes in her skin, such as rashes or lesions?"
Patient [15%]: "They're mostly on her back and legs, but I've seen a few on her arms too. They're pretty small, but like I said, they don't go away when I press on them. And no, I haven't noticed any rashes or lesions, just those bluish spots."
Doctor [20%]: "Have you noticed any unusual swelling or puffiness in her face, hands, or feet, and has her appetite been normal or has she been having trouble feeding?"
Patient [20%]: "No, no swelling or puffiness that I've noticed. And yeah, she's been eating okay, I think. I mean, she's been feeding, but sometimes she seems really tired or sleepy during feedings, and it takes her a while to finish."
Doctor [25%]: "How would you describe her cry, is it strong and loud or more weak and muted? And have you noticed any abnormal movements or twitching in her arms and legs?"
Patient [25%]: "Her cry is pretty weak, to be honest. It's not very loud, and sometimes it's more of a whimper than a cry. And yeah, I have noticed that her arms and legs seem to jerk or twitch a lot, especially when she's trying to eat or get comfortable."
Doctor [30%]: "Has your baby had any issues with breathing, such as rapid breathing, wheezing, or apnea, and have you noticed any unusual postures or positions that she prefers, like always holding her head to one side?"
Patient [30%]: "Yeah, she does breathe kind of fast sometimes, but I'm not sure if that's normal or not. And, yeah, she does seem to like to hold her head to one side, especially when she's sleeping or relaxing. I've also noticed that she likes to keep her knees bent up and her feet flexed, it looks kind of awkward, but she seems comfortable like that."
Doctor [35%]: "Has your baby been having regular, wet diapers, and has she been having any difficulty with bowel movements or stooling?"
Patient [35%]: "Yeah, she's been having regular wet diapers, so I think her kidneys are working okay. And as for bowel movements, she's been having pretty frequent stools, but they're always really runny and watery. I'm not sure if that's normal or not."
Doctor [40%]: "Have you noticed any abnormal odors or colors to her stools, and have you seen any vomiting or spitting up after feedings?"
Patient [40%]: "Yeah, the stools do have a really strong, sweet smell, which seems weird to me. And yes, she has been spitting up a lot after feedings, sometimes it's just a little, but other times it's a lot, and it seems like she's bringing up most of what she just ate."
Doctor [45%]: "Can you tell me more about her spitting up? Is it happening immediately after feedings or more delayed, and have you noticed any blood or bile in the spit-up?"
Patient [45%]: "It usually happens pretty soon after feedings, sometimes it's like she's not even finished eating and she's already spitting up. And no, I haven't seen any blood or bile, it's just a lot of milky liquid. It's like her body can't handle the milk or something."
Doctor [50%]: "Has your baby been gaining weight normally, and have you noticed any changes in her overall alertness or responsiveness, such as being more lethargic or sleepy than usual?"
Patient [50%]: "Actually, I think she's been losing a little weight. The nurses at the hospital were worried about it, but I didn't think much of it at the time. And yeah, she does seem really sleepy a lot, especially after feedings. Sometimes it takes her a while to wake up, and even when she's awake, she doesn't seem very alert or interested in her surroundings."
Doctor [55%]: "Are you breastfed or formula-fed, and have you noticed any difference in her symptoms or behavior based on what she's eating?"
Patient [55%]: "I'm breastfeeding her right now, but I was thinking of switching to formula because I've heard that might help with the spitting up and digestive issues. But honestly, I'm not sure if it'll make a difference. She's been having trouble latching and staying awake during feedings, so I've been supplementing with formula anyway."
Doctor [60%]: "Can you tell me more about her trouble latching and staying awake during feedings? Is it a struggle to get her to latch on, and does she tend to fall asleep quickly after starting to feed?"
Patient [60%]: "Yes, it's been a struggle to get her to latch on, and even when she does, she doesn't seem very interested in eating. She'll start out okay, but then she'll just kind of... zone out, you know? And yeah, she falls asleep really quickly after starting to feed. Sometimes it's like she's not even hungry, but I know she needs to eat, so I try to keep her awake and interested, but it's hard."
Doctor [65%]: "Can you tell me more about her overall muscle tone, is she floppy or stiff, and have you noticed any abnormal reflexes or responses to stimuli?"
Patient [65%]: "Yeah, she does seem kind of floppy, to be honest. Like, if I hold her arm or leg, it just kind of flops around instead of holding its own. And sometimes when I try to move her arms or legs, they seem really stiff and resistant. As for reflexes, I'm not really sure what's normal, but she doesn't seem to respond much to loud noises or bright lights. Sometimes I'll clap my hands or make a loud noise, and she just kind of... blinks, you know? It's like she doesn't even notice."
Doctor [70%]: "Have you noticed any abnormal facial features or expressions, such as a flat or small nose, a small jaw, or a tongue that seems too large for her mouth?"
Patient [70%]: "Now that you mention it, her nose does seem a bit small, and her jaw is kind of narrow. And yeah, her tongue does seem big for her mouth. I've had trouble getting her to latch on because of it. But I just thought that was how newborns were supposed to look, I didn't think it was abnormal or anything."
Doctor [75%]: "Can you tell me more about her tongue, is it protruding or does it seem to be hanging low in her mouth, and have you noticed any difficulty with her swallowing or making sounds?"
Patient [75%]: "Yes, her tongue does seem to be hanging a bit low in her mouth, and it's always kind of protruding. And yeah, I have noticed that she has trouble swallowing sometimes. She'll be eating, and then all of a sudden, she'll start choking or gagging, and I'll have to burp her or try to get her to cough it up. As for making sounds, she doesn't really make much of a noise when she's trying to eat or communicate. It's like she can't get the words out or something."
Doctor [80%]: "Based on what you've told me, I'm going to go ahead and REQUEST TEST: Echocardiogram to get a closer look at her heart and that murmur. I also want to REQUEST TEST: Chromosomal analysis to rule out any potential genetic disorders. In the meantime, can you tell me more about your family medical history, are there any known genetic conditions or congenital heart defects in your or your partner's families?"
Measurement [80%]: RESULTS: Patent ductus arteriosus
Doctor [85%]: "Thank you for sharing that information. Based on the results of the echocardiogram, it looks like your baby has a patent ductus arteriosus, which is a congenital heart defect. Can you tell me more about your family medical history, are there any known genetic conditions or congenital heart defects in your or your partner's families?"
Patient [85%]: "No, I don't think so. I mean, I don't have any siblings or relatives with heart defects that I know of. My partner's family is pretty healthy too, as far as I know. We're both pretty young, so I guess I didn't think this kind of thing could happen to us."
Doctor [90%]: "The chromosomal analysis results are still pending, but based on your baby's symptoms and the patent ductus arteriosus, I'm starting to suspect a possible genetic disorder. Can you tell me more about your pregnancy, were there any complications or issues during the pregnancy that you're aware of?"
Patient [90%]: "Well, like I said, I didn't really get any prenatal care, so I didn't have any ultrasounds or check-ups until I went into labor. I was young and didn't know any better, I guess. But I did have a pretty rough pregnancy, to be honest. I had a lot of morning sickness and fatigue, and I was really stressed out about being a new mom and not knowing what I was doing. But I didn't think that would affect the baby... I mean, I thought I was healthy, so I didn't think it would be a big deal."
Doctor [95%]: "I see. Well, lack of prenatal care can make it harder to identify potential issues earlier on. I'm going to REQUEST TEST: TORCH panel to rule out any possible infections that might be contributing to your baby's symptoms. In the meantime, can you tell me more about your morning sickness, was it particularly severe or persistent?"
Measurement [95%]: RESULTS: Rubella_IgM: Positive, Others: Negative
Doctor [100%]: "Based on all the symptoms and test results, I believe your baby has Congenital Rubella Syndrome. The patent ductus arteriosus, cloudy eyes, blue spots on the skin, weak cry, floppy muscles, small nose, and tongue issues all point to this diagnosis. The positive Rubella IgM result confirms it. I'm so sorry to have to give you this news, but I want to assure you that we'll do everything we can to support you and your baby through this." DIAGNOSIS READY: Congenital Rubella Syndrome

Correct answer: Congenital Rubella Infection
