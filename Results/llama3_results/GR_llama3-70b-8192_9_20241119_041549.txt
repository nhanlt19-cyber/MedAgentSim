Doctor [5%]: So you're experiencing postpartum fever and abdominal tenderness. Can you tell me how long ago you gave birth and if it was a vaginal delivery or C-section?
Patient [5%]: "I gave birth about a week ago, and it was a vaginal delivery. The labor was pretty long and difficult, to be honest."
Doctor [10%]: "How's your wound healing from the episiotomy, if you had one? Any signs of redness, swelling, or discharge from the incision site?"
Patient [10%]: "It's been a bit painful, to be honest. I do have some swelling and redness around the area, but I haven't noticed any discharge. It's just been feeling really sore and tender, especially when I move around or try to breastfeed."
Doctor [15%]: "Have you noticed any abnormal bleeding or lochia, such as a strong odor or an excessive amount of blood?"
Patient [15%]: "Yes, I've been experiencing a lot of bleeding, more than I expected. It's been pretty heavy and has a strong smell. I've also been changing my pads frequently, but I'm not sure if that's normal or not."
Doctor [20%]: "Can you tell me more about the abdominal tenderness you're experiencing? Is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or more of a cramping sensation? And is it localized to a specific area or more of a general discomfort?"
Patient [20%]: "It's more of a dull ache, to be honest. It feels like my whole abdomen is sore and tender, especially when I try to move around or cough. And it seems to be worse on the lower left side, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly."
Doctor [25%]: "Have you been experiencing any nausea or vomiting, and are you able to keep down fluids and food?"
Patient [25%]: "I haven't been vomiting, but I have been feeling a bit nauseous at times. As for eating and drinking, I'm managing, but it's been a bit of a struggle. I get full really quickly and haven't had much of an appetite lately."
Doctor [30%]: "Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements, such as constipation or diarrhea, since giving birth?"
Patient [30%]: "Actually, yes. I have been experiencing some constipation. I've had a hard time going to the bathroom, and when I do, it's been pretty painful. It's like my body is just not wanting to cooperate right now."
Doctor [35%]: "Can you tell me more about your urinary habits since giving birth? Have you experienced any burning sensations or pain while urinating, and are you able to empty your bladder fully?"
Patient [35%]: "Yeah, I've been having to go to the bathroom a lot more frequently than usual, and it's been a bit painful at times. I don't feel like I'm emptying my bladder fully, like there's always some leftover. And sometimes I get this burning sensation when I pee, it's really uncomfortable."
Doctor [40%]: "Have you noticed any discharge or unusual odors from your urine, and have you experienced any urgency or incontinence issues since giving birth?"
Patient [40%]: "Yes, I have noticed a bit of discharge, but I'm not sure if it's normal or not. And as for urgency, yeah, I've had a few accidents where I couldn't make it to the bathroom in time. It's been really embarrassing and frustrating, to be honest."
Doctor [45%]: "Can you tell me about your breast feeding experience? Is it painful or difficult to latch, and have you noticed any nipple discharge or soreness?"
Patient [45%]: "Breastfeeding has been a bit of a challenge, to be honest. I've been experiencing some nipple soreness and tenderness, and it's been painful to latch my baby on at times. I've also noticed some discharge, but I'm not sure if that's normal or not. My lactation consultant said it might be due to some engorgement, but I'm not really sure."
Doctor [50%]: "Have you experienced any headaches, fatigue, or general feeling of being unwell since giving birth, aside from the fever and abdominal tenderness?"
Patient [50%]: "Yes, I've been feeling really fatigued and exhausted, almost like I'm running on empty. And I have had some headaches, mostly mild but annoying. As for feeling unwell, yeah, I just don't feel like myself. I've been feeling really sluggish and worn out, like I need to sleep for a week or something."
Doctor [55%]: "Can you tell me more about your support system at home? Do you have help with taking care of your baby, and are you able to get rest when you need it?"
Patient [55%]: "Yeah, I'm lucky to have a supportive partner who's been helping me out a lot. He's been taking care of the baby at night and doing household chores, which has been a huge relief. As for rest, it's been a challenge. I've been trying to nap when the baby naps, but it's not always easy. I feel like I'm always 'on' and can't really relax, you know?"
Doctor [60%]: "Have you been taking any pain medications or antibiotics since giving birth, and if so, what kind and how often?"
Patient [60%]: "Actually, yes. I was prescribed some pain meds after giving birth, but I've been trying to take them sparingly. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to still be taking them, to be honest. And as for antibiotics, I don't think I've been prescribed any, at least not that I can remember. Unless they were in my IV during labor, I'm not really sure."

Patient [65%]: "My fever has been pretty consistent, ranging from 100.4 to 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. It seems to spike more at night, especially after breastfeeding or when I'm trying to get some rest. Sometimes it feels like my body is just radiating heat, and I get these cold sweats that are really uncomfortable."
Doctor [70%]: "Have you noticed any changes in your vaginal discharge or lochia since you started experiencing the fever and abdominal tenderness?"
Patient [70%]: "Yeah, my lochia has changed a bit since I started feeling unwell. It's been getting thicker and darker, and I've noticed more clots than I did initially. I'm not sure if that's normal or not, but it's definitely been concerning me."
Doctor [75%]: "Have you experienced any difficulty moving around or performing daily activities due to your abdominal tenderness and fever?"
Patient [75%]: "Yes, it's been really tough. Even simple tasks like getting out of bed or going to the bathroom feel like a huge accomplishment. I get winded easily and feel like I need to take a nap after doing anything remotely physical. It's frustrating because I want to take care of my baby and do all the things I'm supposed to do, but my body just doesn't seem to be cooperating."
Doctor [80%]: "Can you tell me if you've had any uterine cramping or contractions since giving birth, and if so, how severe have they been?"
Patient [80%]: "Yeah, I've been experiencing some uterine cramping, especially after breastfeeding. It's been feeling like mild contractions, but they're uncomfortable and catch me off guard sometimes. They're not as intense as the ones I had during labor, but they're still pretty noticeable."
Doctor [85%]: "Can you tell me if you've noticed any unusual swelling or redness in your legs or calves since giving birth?"
Patient [85%]: "Actually, yes. I have noticed some swelling in my ankles and calves, which I thought was just part of the whole postpartum thing. But it's been getting worse, and my legs feel really heavy and achy. I'm not sure if that's normal or not."
