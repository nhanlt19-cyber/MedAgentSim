Doctor [5%]: Can you tell me more about these episodes of unresponsiveness? How often have you been experiencing them, and how long do they typically last?
Patient [5%]: "Uh-huh. They've been happening a lot lately. Like, almost every day. Sometimes two or three times a day. And they usually last, um, a few minutes, I think. My mom says it's like 3 or 4 minutes. But I don't know, 'cause I don't remember anything during that time."
Doctor [10%]: Do you experience anything unusual right before these episodes, like a strange smell or taste, or any kind of sensation in your body?
Patient [10%]: "Yeah, there's this yucky taste in my mouth right before it happens. It's like... muddy, I guess. And sometimes my mouth feels a little funny, too. But that's all."
Doctor [15%]: Can you describe this funny sensation in your mouth further? Is it like a numbness or a tingling feeling?
Patient [15%]: "It's hard to describe... it's just, like, my mouth feels different, you know? Not numb or tingling, just... weird. And it only happens right before the episode starts."
Doctor [20%]: Do you experience any kind of warning signs or symptoms after the episode is over, like headaches or confusion?
Patient [20%]: "Yeah, I usually feel really tired and confused after it's over. Like, I don't know what happened or where I am or anything. It takes me a little while to figure it out. And my head feels kind of... foggy, I guess."
Doctor [25%]: Have you ever injured your head or had a concussion in the past?
Patient [25%]: "Nuh-uh, no. I don't think so. I'm pretty clumsy, so I've fallen down a lot, but I don't remember hitting my head or anything like that."
Doctor [30%]: Do you experience any kind of seizures or convulsions during these episodes of unresponsiveness, or is it more of a "zoning out" or "staring off into space" type of behavior?
Patient [30%]: "It's more like I'm staring off into space. My brother said I was making weird faces and my eyes were all weird, but I don't remember doing that. It's like my body is doing stuff, but I'm not in control or anything."
Doctor [35%]: Have you noticed any triggers that might set off these episodes, such as certain foods, emotions, or activities?
Patient [35%]: "Hmm, no... I don't think so. They just seem to happen whenever. My mom said it happened once when I was playing with my Legos, and another time when I was watching TV. But it's not like I was doing anything special or different. It just... happens."
Doctor [40%]: Do you have a family history of any kind of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy or migraines?
Patient [40%]: "Uh, no... I don't think so. My mom and dad are pretty healthy, and my brother and I are usually pretty healthy too. I don't know about my grandparents or anything, though."
Doctor [45%]: Can you tell me more about the facial grimacing you experience during these episodes? Is it more of a twitching or a stiffening of your facial muscles?
Patient [45%]: "It's like... my face does this weird, scrunched-up thing. It's not like I'm trying to make a face, it just happens. And my eyes get all weird too. My brother said it looks like I'm looking at something that's not there. It's like my face is doing its own thing, and I'm not in control of it."
Doctor [50%]: Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep patterns recently?
Patient [50%]: "Yeah, I've been feeling really tired lately, and I don't wanna eat as much as I used to. My mom says I've been skipping breakfast sometimes, and I just don't feel hungry in the morning. And sometimes I have trouble falling asleep at night, too."
Doctor [55%]: Have you noticed any changes in your emotions or mood lately, such as feeling anxious or depressed?
Patient [55%]: "Yeah, sometimes I feel really sad or worried for no reason. My mom says I've been getting frustrated easily, too. Like, if I can't do something or if I make a mistake, I get really upset. But I don't know why I'm feeling that way, it just happens."
Doctor [60%]: Can you tell me more about these feelings of sadness and worry? Are they constant, or do they come and go?
Patient [60%]: "They come and go, I think. Sometimes I'll be playing and then suddenly I'll just feel really sad and I don't know why. It's like, I'll be thinking about something, and then my thoughts just get all mixed up and I start feeling bad. And then sometimes it just goes away, and I'm fine again. But sometimes it takes a little while to go away."
Doctor [65%]: Can you tell me more about these mixed-up thoughts of yours? Are they more like worries about the future or regrets about the past?
Patient [65%]: "Hmm, it's hard to explain... I don't think it's really about the future or the past. It's just like, my thoughts get all jumbled up and I can't make sense of them. Sometimes I'll be thinking about something happy, like playing with my friends, and then suddenly I'll start thinking about something that makes me sad, like my dog that died. And then I'll just feel really sad and worried, and I don't know why."
Doctor [70%]: Have you experienced any memory problems or difficulty concentrating in between these episodes of unresponsiveness?
Patient [70%]: "Yeah, sometimes I have trouble remembering what I was doing before the episode happened. And sometimes my teacher says I'm not paying attention in class, but I'm trying, it's just hard to focus. It's like my brain is foggy or something."
Doctor [75%]: Do you experience any kind of jerking or twitching of your arms or legs during these episodes, or is it mainly just your facial muscles that are affected?
Patient [75%]: "Yeah, sometimes my hands will do weird things too. Like, my brother said I was making funny gestures with my hands during one of the episodes. But I don't remember doing it. It's like my body is moving on its own or something."
Doctor [80%]: Do you experience any kind of sensation or feeling in your hands or arms right before the episode starts, like tingling or numbness?
Patient [80%]: "Hmm, yeah... sometimes my hands feel a little weird right before it happens. It's like they're all tingly or something. But it's not like they're numb or anything, it's just... different."
Doctor [85%]: Do you experience any kind of stomach issues or nausea during or after these episodes?
Patient [85%]: "No, I don't think so. My tummy might feel a little weird sometimes after it's over, but it's not like I feel nauseous or anything. It's more like... my whole body just feels tired and worn out, you know?"
Doctor [90%]: Can you tell me more about this weird feeling in your tummy after the episode is over? Is it like a cramp or a discomfort?
Patient [90%]: "It's hard to explain... it's not really a cramp or a discomfort, it's more like... my tummy just feels different. Like, it's all relaxed or something. It's not uncomfortable, it's just... weird. And it goes away after a little while, too."
Doctor [95%]: Have you ever experienced any kind of unusual smells or sensations during these episodes, like a strange odor or a feeling of déjà vu?
Patient [95%]: "Hmm, no... I don't think so. I don't remember smelling anything weird or feeling like I've been there before. It's just... my face does that weird thing, and I zone out, and then it's over. But, wait, my brother did say I was sniffing the air once during an episode. I don't remember doing that, though."
