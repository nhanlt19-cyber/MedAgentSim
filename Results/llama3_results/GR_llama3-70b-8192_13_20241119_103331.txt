Doctor [5%]: "How old is your infant, and when did you first notice the bilious vomiting and abdominal distension?"
Patient [5%]: "He's only 2 days old, and I first noticed the vomiting after the first feeding. The abdomen started to look bigger after that, and it's been getting worse since then."
Doctor [10%]: "Has the infant had a bowel movement at all since birth, and have you noticed any other symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, or lethargy?"
Patient [10%]: "No, he hasn't had a bowel movement yet, and the mom hasn't noticed any fever or diarrhea. But he does seem quite fussy and uncomfortable, like he's in distress."
Doctor [15%]: "Can you tell me more about the vomiting? Is it projectile, and is there any blood or bile present in the vomit? Has the infant been able to feed properly since the first feeding?"
Patient [15%]: "It's been projectile, and yeah, there's bile in the vomit. It's like a yellowish-green color. As for feeding, he's been having trouble latching on and staying interested. Even when he does feed, it doesn't seem like he's getting much, and then the vomiting happens soon after."
Doctor [20%]: "Has the infant been passing urine normally, and have you noticed any other signs of distress such as rapid breathing or grunting?"
Patient [20%]: "Yes, he's been passing urine normally, and yeah, his breathing has been really rapid. It's like he's breathing really fast, and sometimes he even grunts or makes these little whimpering sounds. It's like he's trying to tell us something is wrong."
Doctor [25%]: "Has the mother had any complications during pregnancy, and was the delivery normal or were there any issues during labor?"
Patient [25%]: "No, the pregnancy was normal, and the delivery was a home birth without any complications. Everything seemed normal until after the first feeding when the vomiting started."
Doctor [30%]: "Has the infant been crying excessively or showing any signs of abdominal tenderness, such as drawing their legs up or showing discomfort when their abdomen is touched?"
Patient [30%]: "Oh, yes! He's been crying a lot, and it's not just a normal cry, it's more like a wail. And when you touch his belly, he gets really upset and pulls his legs up. It's like he's trying to protect himself from the discomfort."
Doctor [35%]: "Can you tell me if the mother has been taking any medications or supplements during pregnancy that might be related to the infant's symptoms?"
Patient [35%]: "No, the mother didn't take anything out of the ordinary during pregnancy. She stuck to prenatal vitamins and didn't even take any antibiotics or anything like that."
Doctor [40%]: "Has the infant been having any abnormal movements or posturing, such as arching of the back or stiffening of the legs, which might indicate abdominal pain or discomfort?"
Patient [40%]: "Yes, that's exactly what he does! He arches his back and stiffens his legs, especially when he's vomiting or when you touch his belly. It's like he's trying to stretch away from the discomfort."
Doctor [45%]: "Has the mother noticed any abnormalities with the infant's umbilical cord, such as redness, swelling, or discharge?"
Patient [45%]: "Actually, yes, she mentioned that the umbilical cord area does look a bit red and swollen. It seems a bit bigger than normal, but we didn't think much of it at first."
Doctor [50%]: "Can you tell me more about the infant's overall tone and muscle strength? Does he seem floppy or hypotonic, or is he generally stiff or hypertonic?"
Patient [50%]: "He's actually been a bit floppy and limp, especially after the vomiting episodes. His limbs seem to just dangle, and he doesn't really respond much when you try to move them or elicit a reflex."
Doctor [55%]: "Has the mother noticed any nipple confusion or difficulty latching, and has the infant been able to take a full feeding or does it seem like he's not getting enough?"
Patient [55%]: "Yes, the mom has had trouble getting him to latch on, and even when he does, it's like he's not really interested in feeding. He'll only take a little bit and then pull away, and sometimes he just starts crying and vomiting again. It's like he's not getting enough, and that's why he's still hungry and uncomfortable."
Doctor [60%]: "Has the infant been making any unusual sounds while feeding, such as clicking, gasping, or grunting, which could indicate difficulty with suck-swallow coordination?"
Patient [60%]: "Oh, yes! He does make these little clicking and gasping sounds when he's trying to feed. It's like he's struggling to get the milk down or something. And sometimes, he even grunts a little, like he's having trouble swallowing."
Doctor [65%]: "Has the mother tried any different feeding positions or techniques, such as upright or side-lying, to see if that makes a difference in the infant's ability to feed?"
Patient [65%]: "Yeah, she's tried a few different positions, but nothing seems to make a difference. She's tried holding him upright, side-lying, and even using a nipple shield, but he still struggles to latch on and feed properly."
Doctor [70%]: "Has the mother tried expressing breastmilk and feeding the infant through a bottle or syringe to see if he has an easier time getting nutrition that way?"
Patient [70%]: "Yeah, she's tried expressing breastmilk and feeding it to him through a bottle, but he still doesn't seem to be getting enough. He gets frustrated and starts crying, and eventually, the vomiting happens again. We're not sure what to do at this point."
Doctor [75%]: "Can you tell me more about the mother's breastmilk supply? Is it abundant, or does she feel like she's not producing enough milk?"
Patient [75%]: "The mom says she's been having a hard time getting her milk to come in. She's been trying to express it, but it's been really slow and not very much comes out. She's worried that she's not producing enough milk for him, which is why she's been trying to supplement with formula."
Doctor [80%]: "Has the infant been showing any signs of jaundice, such as yellowing of the skin and eyes, which could indicate a problem with bilirubin metabolism?"
Patient [80%]: "Yeah, the mom has noticed that his skin and eyes have a slight yellow tint to them. We thought it might be normal, but it's been getting worse over the past day or so."
Doctor [85%]: "Has the infant's jaundice been getting worse, and are there any other signs of liver or gallbladder dysfunction, such as dark urine or pale stools?"
Patient [85%]: "Yes, the jaundice has been getting worse, and we've noticed that his urine is really dark and concentrated. As for stools, we haven't seen any yet, but like I said, he hasn't had a bowel movement since birth."

Patient [95%]: "Yes, his abdomen is really tender to the touch. When you press on it, he gets really upset and pulls his legs up. There aren't any obvious masses or lumps that I can feel, but it just feels really tight and firm, like it's swollen or something."
