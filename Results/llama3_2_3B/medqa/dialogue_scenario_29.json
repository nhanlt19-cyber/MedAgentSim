Based on the symptoms you've described, the elevated white blood cell count, and the presence of Gram-negative diplococci in the joint aspiration fluid, I'm going to take a guess that you might have contracted a type of bacterial infection. Specifically, I'm thinking that you might have contracted Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacteria that causes gonorrhea. The fact that you recently went on a camping trip and engaged in water activities, such as swimming, increases the risk of transmission. \"Given the symptoms you've described, I'm also going to consider the possibility of a co-infection with Chlamydia.
