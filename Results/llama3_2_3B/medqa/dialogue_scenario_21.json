However, I do see some minor signs of inflammation, but it's not as severe as what I'm seeing in your right knee. Can you tell me more about your eye symptoms? You mentioned that your eyes can get a bit red and swollen sometimes, especially after rubbing your eyes a lot. Does that happen frequently, or is it more of an occasional occurrence?

I'm not sure if it's related to the pain or just general discomfort, but it's been affecting my mood and energy levels. And yeah, bending my knee makes the pain worse, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly where the pain is coming from.
