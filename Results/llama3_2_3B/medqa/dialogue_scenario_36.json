And it's not just when I'm extending my knee, it's also when I'm bearing weight on it, like when I'm standing or walking. And yeah, I've noticed that I've been leaning a bit more to the right when I'm walking, trying to distribute the weight more evenly, but I'm not sure if that's just a habit or if it's related to the lesion. I've also been trying to pay more attention to my posture and make sure I'm not putting too much strain on my knee, but it's hard to know for sure. I've also been doing some research on my own, reading about different types of bone lesions and trying to learn more about what might be going on with my knee.
