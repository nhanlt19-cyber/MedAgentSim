    "text": "It's hard to describe, but when I scratch it, it feels like the skin is reacting to the scratching, like it's a bit inflamed or irritated, and the sensation lingers for a bit after I stop scratching. I've also noticed that the rash seems to be a bit raised, like it's not just a flat spot on my skin, but there's a bit of texture to it. It's not like it's peeling or flaking, but it's definitely not smooth like the rest of my skin."

As for the shape, it's not really a distinct shape, but it's definitely not just a flat spot, it's more of an irregular shape, like it's spreading outwards from the center. And when I say it's raised, it's not the entire area that's raised, it's more like a specific patch of it, just the part where the rash is located, it's like a small bump or a swelling, but it's not a big one, just a small, noticeable one."

My family's been the same for a while, and I don't think anything's changed recently.
