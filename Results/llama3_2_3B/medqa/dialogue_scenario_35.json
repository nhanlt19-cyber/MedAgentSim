Unfortunately, that means that many people with the condition may not even show symptoms until they're older. As for treatment, Glanzmann thrombasthenia can be managed with medications that help control bleeding, such as platelet inhibitors. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair bleeding sites or remove damaged tissue. Now, I want to ask you a few more questions to confirm the diagnosis. Can you tell me more about your bleeding episodes? How often do they occur, and how long do they last? And while we're on the topic of treatment, I want to discuss the possibility of a bone marrow transplant with you and your parents. It's a treatment option that may be available for some people with Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Also, I'd like to request some further imaging tests to confirm the diagnosis.
