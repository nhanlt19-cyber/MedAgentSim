As for gripping objects, I normally grip things with a bit more force than I do with my left hand, I guess.

I think it's because I'm not putting as much pressure on the finger, so it's not as irritated. But when I do have to use my right hand, like when I'm carrying my backpack or shaking hands with people, the pain comes back pretty quickly. As for my dad's injury, it was a pretty tough road to recovery. He had to have surgery and physical therapy, and even after all that, he still had some lingering problems. He had to adjust his grip and throwing style to avoid putting too much strain on his wrist. It took him a while to get back to his normal activities, but he was able to do so without any major issues."
