I've also had some occasional nausea, but it's not something that's constant and it usually goes away on its own after a bit."

I'd say it's about 2-3 times a week, and it usually lasts for a few hours before it goes away on its own. It started about 6 months ago, I'm not really sure when it first started, but it's been a steady presence in my life ever since."

I've been to the doctor a few times for those, and it's just been a matter of taking some antibiotics and waiting for the infection to clear up.
