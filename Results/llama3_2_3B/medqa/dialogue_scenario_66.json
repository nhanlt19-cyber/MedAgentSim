    "text": "It seems like we've gathered a lot of information about your episodes of apnea and anemia. I'm going to review everything one more time to make a diagnosis. Based on your symptoms, physical examination, and test results, I'm going to take a guess that you might have a condition called Congenital Heart Defect, specifically a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). This condition can cause episodes of apnea due to decreased oxygenation of the blood, leading to fatigue and lethargy. The anemia could be related to a decrease in oxygen delivery to the body's tissues. However, I'd like to request some additional information to confirm my suspicion. Can you tell me more about your mother's pregnancy and delivery? Were there any complications or concerns during the pregnancy or delivery? Also, I'd like to request an abdominal ultrasound to check for any signs of cardiac shunting or other structural abnormalities. Please wait for the results of these tests, and I'll be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis."
