Can you tell me more about your family history of joint problems, have any other relatives had similar issues with their shoulders or joints? Patient: Actually, my mom had some issues with her shoulders in the past, but I don't think it was anything serious. I see. I'm going to review the MRI results now and see if I can find any clues about your condition. (Dr. Agent reviews the MRI results) Ah-ha! I think I see something. It looks like there may be some inflammation in the rotator cuff tendons. I'm going to take a guess that you may have a case of rotator cuff tendinitis. DIAGNOSIS READY: Rotator Cuff Tendinit"
