I've been taking Lisinopril for my hypertension, and I'm also on rectal mesalamine for my ulcerative colitis. I don't think I've had any other medications recently, but I'll double-check my prescription bottles to be sure. And I've had ulcerative colitis for about 5 years now, as I mentioned earlier. It's been pretty stable, but I have had some flare-ups in the past. I'm not sure if this is related to the itching, but I'll do my best to remember any other symptoms or changes I've experienced.
