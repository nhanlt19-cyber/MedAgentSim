As for the shortness of breath, it's definitely getting worse, and I'd say it's moderate.

After that, I spend some time responding to emails and getting things done around the house, and then I usually take a break to rest for a bit.

As for my morning routine, I usually wake up early and have a cup of coffee, then head to the gym for about 30 minutes of light cardio and stretching. I try to get in some yoga or Pilates afterwards to help with flexibility and balance. I don't really do any high-intensity exercise, just something to get my blood flowing and help me feel more alert."
