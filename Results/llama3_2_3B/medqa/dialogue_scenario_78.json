Also, since the episode started suddenly, I'd like to perform a quick neurological exam to check for any signs of abnormal reflexes or coordination. Can you stand up for me and hold onto the bed for a second while I do a quick Romberg test?"

As for standing up, I'm not feeling very stable, I'm holding onto the bed for support, and I'm having trouble keeping my balance, I'm swaying a bit. I didn't feel any numbness or tingling sensations in my face or extremities, but I did feel a bit dizzy afterwards."
