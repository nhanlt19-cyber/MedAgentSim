The skin scraping and stool sample were both negative for bacterial or fungal infections, which is good to know. However, the fact that the rash is itchy and sensitive to scratching, and that you've been experiencing mood changes and irritability, suggests that there might be an underlying inflammatory or autoimmune process at play.

It seems that you were born around the time when the varicella vaccine was introduced, and you may have been exposed to the varicella virus at birth. This could potentially lead to a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia, which is characterized by a persistent rash and itching sensation after a viral infection. I'd like to run some further tests to confirm this diagnosis, but I think we're on the right track. Can you tell me a bit more about your symptoms and when they started?
