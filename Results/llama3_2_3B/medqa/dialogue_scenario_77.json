    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "The cough is pretty consistent, I'd say. It's more of a productive cough, where I cough up a lot of mucus, especially in the morning and evening. It's not constant, but it's always there, and it's gotten worse over the past few days."

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
