I don't really notice any specific triggers, but I do get pretty anxious when I'm in crowded places or when I've got a lot on my plate. Like, yesterday I was at a party and it was really loud, and I just felt like I was gonna lose it, you know?"

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Doc, to be honest, I've been having a hard time sleeping lately. I'll lie down, but I'll just end up lying there, wide awake, thinking about all the things that are stressing me out. And when I do manage to fall asleep, I wake up feeling pretty anxious, like my mind's still racing."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, doc, I haven't really noticed a big change in my appetite, but I have been eating a bit more than usual, I guess, just because I'm trying to calm my nerves. As for energy levels, I feel pretty drained, to be honest, like I'm always running on empty."

Do you feel like you're able to get through your daily activities without needing to rest, or do you find yourself needing to take breaks more often than usual?

And yeah, the yellowing of my skin and eyes is pretty noticeable, especially on my hands and feet. It's like my fingers and toes are really pale and yellow at the same time."
