Are there any specific positions or movements that exacerbate the pain, or are there certain times of the day when the pain seems to be more pronounced? I'd say it's pretty consistent - the pain seems to be worse when I'm gripping or twisting my thumb, and it's also worse when I'm in a position where my wrist is flexed or extended, like when I'm holding my baby or doing household chores. Doctor: Okay, I'd like to do a few more tests to confirm the diagnosis. I'm going to ask you to perform a squeeze test, where I'll ask you to squeeze my hand for a few seconds and then release it. This will help me assess the tendons in your wrist and see if they're inflamed. Are you ready to do that?"

I'd like to ask a few more questions to confirm the diagnosis. Can you tell me more about the activities that make the pain worse, especially in terms of the position of your wrist? For example, do you find that holding your baby close to your chest exacerbates the pain, or is it more related to the way you're holding your arm? Also, I'd like to request test results for an Arthrocentesis, which is a procedure where a small sample of fluid is withdrawn from the wrist joint to check for signs of inflammation or infection.
