Based on your symptoms and the test results, I'm going to take a guess that you might have a condition called congenital hypothyroidism. This condition is caused by a lack of thyroid hormone production in the body, which can affect the development of the nervous system and other organs. It's a common cause of developmental delays and feeding difficulties in newborns. I'd like to request some more images of your thyroid gland to confirm this diagnosis. Can you please request a thyroid ultrasound? Also, I'd like to discuss treatment options with your mother. We'll need to start your on thyroid hormone replacement therapy to help stimulate the production of thyroid hormones in your body. This will help improve your feeding and overall development. Is that something you think you'd be comfortable with?"
