    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I think it started about a month ago, and to be honest, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster - some days are really manageable, but other days it feels like everything is just a bit more challenging than usual."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I haven't really noticed any issues with my speech or swallowing. I can still talk and eat just fine, but I do have to admit that sometimes when I'm feeling really fatigued, my words get a bit jumbled and I stumble over my sentences."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in your neck, shoulders, or back?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I have noticed that my neck and shoulders feel a bit stiff, especially after a long day of sitting at my desk. It's not sharp pain, but more of a dull ache that's been persistent lately."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any recent head injuries or trauma that could have caused these symptoms? Please respond as the patient."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I haven't had any recent head injuries or trauma. I did trip on the stairs a few weeks ago, but it was just a minor fall and I didn't hit my head. I don't think that would have caused these symptoms, though - the pain and stiffness in my neck and shoulders seem more related to my daily activities."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've noticed that my double vision tends to get worse when I'm in bright lights or looking at something up close for a bit too long. It's not constant, though - sometimes it's barely noticeable, and other times it's quite pronounced."

  },

    "speaker": "Patient",

    "text": "Have you experienced any difficulty with your eyelids, such as drooping or difficulty opening them?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. My eyelids seem to be working normally, but sometimes when I'm tired, my eyes can feel a bit heavy and it takes me a bit longer to blink or close them."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Not really, I mean, I do get a bit of a tremor when I'm really fatigued, but it's not constant and it's not as bad as my arm weakness when I try to brush my hair. It's more of a general feeling of unsteadiness, like my whole body is wobbly."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any difficulty with your reflexes, such as a slow or absent response when I tap your knee or ankle with my reflex hammer?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. My reflexes seem to be normal, but I do get a bit of a delay when I'm feeling really fatigued."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've noticed that when I try to do things like brush my hair or tie my shoes, my arm feels really weak and it's hard to coordinate my movements. Sometimes I have to take a deep breath and focus really hard to get everything done smoothly."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any difficulty with swallowing or choking on food or liquids?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I have noticed that sometimes when I'm eating or drinking, my food or liquid can feel like it's going to slip out of my mouth, but I've never actually choked on anything. I've just learned to be a bit more mindful of my eating and drinking to avoid spills."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I do get a bit of a tingling sensation in my hands when I've been sitting or standing for a long time, but it's not really numbness, more like a pins-and-needles feeling."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Can you stand up and walk over to the wall for me? I'd like to observe how you move and see if you have any difficulty with coordination or balance."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, of course, I can do that. *gets up slowly, takes a few deep breaths, and starts to walk towards the wall, holding onto the edge of the bed for support*"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "As you're walking, I notice that you're taking slow and deliberate steps, and you're holding onto the bed for support. Can you tell me if you've experienced any difficulty with your legs feeling weak or unsteady when you walk?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, to be honest, my legs do feel a bit wobbly when I'm walking, especially if I've been standing or sitting for a long time. It's like my body needs a bit of time to adjust before I can take steady steps."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your symptoms and movements. Can you tell me if you've experienced any difficulty with your bladder control, such as leakage or urgency to urinate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've noticed that I do have to make more frequent trips to the bathroom, especially after physical activity, but I don't think I've ever experienced any leakage or loss of bladder control. I just feel like I need to go more often, and it's been a bit of an adjustment getting used to that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Based on your symptoms of double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, upper limb weakness, fatigue, and coordination issues, I'm going to take a closer look at your reflexes and muscle strength. Can you please extend your arm straight out in front of you and hold it still for me?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I'll do my best to hold it steady. *extends arm straight out in front of me and holds it still, taking a deep breath to try and relax my muscles*"
