Doctor [85%]: Given the lack of jaundice, normal bowel movements, and breathing, along with the symptoms of feeding difficulties, weight gain despite reduced intake, and abdominal distension, it's important to consider all possibilities. Has your child's urine been darker than usual or had any unusual odors that might indicate a metabolic condition?
Patient [85%]: No, his urine seems normal in color and there hasn't been any unusual odor that we've noticed.
Doctor [90%]: Given the symptoms and all the information we've gathered, including the normal test results and absence of common symptoms for other conditions, I'm considering a possible metabolic or endocrine issue that isn't immediately obvious without specific testing. Before making a final decision, I'd like to request one more test to help narrow down the diagnosis. REQUEST TEST: Blood Test for Metabolic Panel and Thyroid Function.
Measurement [90%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [95%]: Given the normal results from the metabolic panel and thyroid function tests, along with the absence of other common symptoms, it's time to consider less common conditions. DIAGNOSIS READY: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)

Patient [30%]: No, I haven't felt like my knee is going to give out on me. It just hurts, especially when I move it a certain way or put pressure on it during volleyball.
Doctor [35%]: Have you tried any treatments at home, like applying ice or taking any over-the-counter pain medications? If so, did they provide any relief?
Patient [35%]: I've tried icing it a few times since yesterday and took some ibuprofen. It helped a little with the pain, but it's still pretty bothersome, especially when I try to move around or bend my knee.
Doctor [40%]: Have you noticed any improvement in the morning, or does the pain seem to be consistent throughout the day?
Patient [40%]: The pain seems to be pretty consistent throughout the day. It doesn't really improve in the morning; it's more about how much I move and use my knee that affects it.
Doctor [45%]: Have you been doing any specific stretches or warm-up exercises before playing volleyball, or did you start playing without any prior preparation?
Patient [45%]: I've been doing some basic stretches before playing, but I didn't really do any specific warm-up exercises for volleyball. I just jumped into playing without much preparation.
Doctor [50%]: Have you noticed if the pain is localized to one specific area of the knee, or does it seem to spread out from the inside part near your shin?
Patient [50%]: The pain feels like it's mostly localized to one specific area, right over the medial aspect of the tibia just below the knee. It doesn't really spread out much from that spot.
Doctor [55%]: Given the location and nature of your pain, have you experienced any difficulty in performing specific movements, such as squatting or climbing stairs?
Patient [55%]: Yes, I've definitely noticed it's harder to squat or climb stairs. Those movements make the pain a lot worse, and I've been trying to avoid them as much as possible.
Doctor [60%]: Given your symptoms and the activities that exacerbate your pain, have you noticed any clicking or grinding sensations in your knee when moving, particularly in the area where you feel the pain?
Patient [60%]: No, I haven't noticed any clicking or grinding sensations in my knee. It's mostly just the sharp pain in that specific area when I move or put pressure on it.

Patient [65%]: The pain mostly stays confined to the knee area. I haven't noticed it radiating down my leg at all.
Doctor [70%]: Given your symptoms and the activities that seem to exacerbate the pain, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in the knee area or in your leg?

Doctor [75%]: Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of the pain with changes in the weather or during certain times of the day?
Patient [75%]: No, I haven't noticed any changes in the pain with the weather or at different times of the day. It seems pretty consistent, regardless of those factors.
Doctor [80%]: Given the specific location of your pain and the activities that exacerbate it, have you tried modifying your activity level or taking a break from volleyball to see if there's any improvement in your symptoms?
Patient [80%]: I haven't really taken a break from volleyball yet since the pain just started yesterday. I was hoping it would just get better on its own, but I'm starting to think maybe I should rest it for a bit and see if that helps.
Doctor [85%]: Given your reluctance to rest initially, but considering doing so now, have you noticed any specific movements or positions that relieve the pain, even temporarily?
Patient [85%]: Actually, keeping my knee straight and not bending it too much seems to help a little. When I elevate my leg, that also seems to provide some temporary relief from the pain.
Doctor [90%]: Given your symptoms and the temporary relief you get from keeping the knee straight and elevating your leg, it's important to assess the structural integrity of your knee. REQUEST TEST: MRI of the knee. This will help us get a detailed view of the internal structures of your knee to better understand the cause of your pain.
Measurement [90%]: RESULTS: MRI_Knee: Optional. Can be considered if clinical suspicion persists despite negative initial workup, not mandatory for diagnosis in this simulated case.
Doctor [95%]: Given the MRI isn't mandatory for diagnosis in this case and based on your symptoms and the activities exacerbating your pain, have you noticed any issues with your knee when it's under less strain, such as when walking on flat surfaces or during light activity?
Patient [95%]: Walking on flat surfaces or doing light activities doesn't seem to bother my knee as much. It's really the more intense movements and pressure from playing volleyball that make the pain worse.

Patient [50%]: No, my right foot doesn't feel colder than my left foot. They seem to be the same temperature.
Doctor [55%]: Given the absence of temperature difference, that's a good sign for circulation. However, to further assess nerve function, can you feel the same level of sensation when you touch both legs, or is there a difference?
Patient [55%]: The sensation feels the same on both legs when I touch them. There's no difference in feeling between the two.
Doctor [60%]: That's reassuring regarding nerve function. Now, I need to check for any potential muscle or tendon injuries that might have occurred alongside the dislocation. Have you noticed any difficulty in moving your hip joint aside from the pain, such as a feeling of resistance or inability to perform certain movements?
Patient [60%]: Yes, there's definitely a feeling of resistance when I try to move my hip joint, and I can't perform certain movements at all without a lot of pain. It feels like my hip won't let me move it in certain directions.
Doctor [65%]: Given your difficulty with movement and the resistance you're feeling, it's important to assess the extent of soft tissue damage around your hip. REQUEST TEST: MRI of the right hip
Measurement [65%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [70%]: Given the MRI results show normal readings for soft tissue, it seems we've ruled out significant muscle or tendon injuries around the hip. This is good news. Can you tell me, since the accident, have you been able to bear any weight at all on the affected leg, even for a short moment?
Patient [70%]: No, I haven't been able to bear any weight on the affected leg at all. Even trying to put a little bit of weight causes a lot of pain and feels impossible.
Doctor [75%]: Given the severity of your symptoms and the inability to bear weight, along with the findings of a posterior hip dislocation, it's clear that immediate treatment is necessary to prevent further complications. Have you experienced any changes in your ability to control your bladder or bowels since the accident?
Patient [75%]: No, I haven't experienced any changes in my ability to control my bladder or bowels since the accident.
Doctor [80%]: That's a relief to hear, as changes in bladder or bowel control can indicate more severe nerve damage. Given all the information and test results, it seems we have a clear picture of your condition. Before we proceed with the next steps, do you have any other symptoms or concerns that you haven't mentioned yet?
Patient [80%]: No, I think we've covered everything. The main issues are just the severe pain, inability to bear weight, and the difficulty moving my leg.
Doctor [85%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Posterior dislocation of the right hip

Correct answer: Posterior hip dislocation

Doctor [5%]: Hello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you tell me when the pain started and if there was any specific activity or event that triggered it?
Patient [5%]: Yes, hello Dr. Agent. The pain started a few hours ago while I was exercising at the gym. I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my lower back during my workout.
Doctor [10%]: Did you lift heavy weights or perform any movements that were new or unusual for you during your workout?
Patient [10%]: No, I was doing my regular routine, nothing new or unusual. But when I felt the pain, it was during a particularly intense part of my workout.
Doctor [15%]: Can you describe the nature of the pain you're experiencing? Is it a constant pain or does it come and go?
Patient [15%]: The pain is sharp and pretty constant, but it definitely gets worse when I move. It also radiates down the side of my leg and into my foot.
Doctor [20%]: Does the pain improve with rest or any particular position, such as lying down or sitting?
Patient [20%]: Yes, lying down seems to help a bit, especially when I'm in a position that doesn't put pressure on my back. Sitting for too long doesn't really help; it actually seems to make the pain a bit worse.
Doctor [25%]: Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your leg or foot along with the pain?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling, just the sharp pain that goes down to my foot.

Doctor [60%]: Have you had any recent sexual activity that could have exposed you to sexually transmitted infections?
Patient [60%]: Yes, I've been sexually active with two partners and haven't always used condoms consistently.
Doctor [65%]: Given your sexual history and the symptoms you've described, it's important to rule out certain conditions. REQUEST TEST: Urinalysis to check for signs of infection and REQUEST TEST: Blood tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, syphilis, and gonorrhea/chlamydia. These tests will help us understand if there's an infection contributing to your symptoms.
Measurement [65%]: RESULTS: Urinalysis shows WBC 12–16/hpf, RBC 1–2/hpf, with Protein and Blood being Negative. ELISA for HIV Result is Negative. Additional tests for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were not provided in the data.
Doctor [70%]: Given the urinalysis results showing white blood cells, it suggests there's some form of infection. Since we don't have the results for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia yet, let's focus on other symptoms. Have you noticed any pain or swelling in other joints besides your knee and previously your ankle?
Patient [70%]: No, I haven't noticed pain or swelling in other joints besides my knee and previously my ankle.
Doctor [75%]: Given the combination of joint pain and swelling, episodes of pain with urination, and eye irritation, have you experienced any mouth ulcers or lesions recently?

Doctor [80%]: Given your symptoms and the tests we've conducted so far, it's important to consider all possibilities. REQUEST TEST: HLA-B27 genetic marker. This test can help us understand if you might have a condition related to the HLA-B27 gene, which is often associated with certain types of arthritis.
Measurement [80%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [85%]: Given the normal HLA-B27 result, it seems less likely that we're dealing with an arthritis type commonly associated with this gene. Considering your symptoms and sexual history, it's crucial to get a complete picture. REQUEST TEST: Complete blood count (CBC) to check for signs of infection or inflammation and REQUEST TEST: X-ray of the right knee to assess for joint damage or disease.
Measurement [85%]: RESULTS: Complete Blood Count shows Hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL, Leukocyte Count 12,300/mm3, Platelet Count 310,000/mm3, indicating signs of infection or inflammation. X-ray results were not provided in the data.
Doctor [90%]: Given the elevated leukocyte count indicating infection or inflammation and the absence of X-ray results, it's important to consider your joint symptoms in the context of your sexual history and urinalysis findings. Have you been previously vaccinated for hepatitis B?
Patient [90%]: No, I haven't been vaccinated for hepatitis B.
Doctor [95%]: Considering your lack of vaccination for hepatitis B, your sexual history, and the symptoms you've described, it's important to also rule out hepatitis B as a potential cause. REQUEST TEST: Hepatitis B surface antigen to check for an active hepatitis B infection.

Patient [15%]: No, I haven't noticed any significant weight loss or changes in my appetite. Everything seems pretty normal in that regard.
Doctor [20%]: Have you had any fever or night sweats along with these symptoms?
Patient [20%]: No, I haven't had any fever or night sweats. It's mostly just been the diarrhea and abdominal discomfort.
Doctor [25%]: Have you been traveling recently or consumed any food or water that you suspect might have been contaminated?
Patient [25%]: Well, I did go camping a few months ago. I can't say for sure if the water was contaminated, but I do remember someone else from the group getting sick around that time too.
Doctor [30%]: Have you or anyone else in your group been tested for any infections after returning from the camping trip?
Patient [30%]: No, none of us got tested after the trip. I didn't think much of it until I started having these symptoms.
Doctor [35%]: Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your symptoms over the past four months?
Patient [35%]: The symptoms have been pretty consistent, no real improvement. The urgency and frequency of the diarrhea have stayed the same, and the abdominal discomfort is always there before I have a bowel movement.
Doctor [40%]: Have you tried any medications or remedies to help with your symptoms? If so, what were they and did you notice any difference after taking them?
Patient [40%]: I tried over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medications a couple of times, but they didn't seem to make much of a difference. I also tried increasing my fiber intake, thinking it might help, but that didn't really change anything either.
Doctor [45%]: Have you had any previous gastrointestinal issues or diagnoses, such as irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, before these symptoms started?
Patient [45%]: No, I've never had any gastrointestinal issues or diagnoses like that before. This is the first time I've experienced anything like this.
Doctor [50%]: Have you noticed any joint pain, eye irritation, or skin rashes along with your symptoms?
Patient [50%]: No, I haven't experienced any joint pain, eye irritation, or skin rashes. It's really just been the gastrointestinal symptoms I mentioned.
Doctor [55%]: Given your symptoms and the fact that someone else in your group got sick after the camping trip, it's possible you might have contracted an infection. REQUEST TEST: Stool culture to check for any pathogens that could be causing your symptoms.
Measurement [55%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [60%]: Given the normal stool culture results, it's important to explore other causes for your symptoms. Have you noticed any relation between your symptoms and the consumption of specific foods, such as dairy or gluten?
Patient [60%]: I haven't really paid much attention to how specific foods affect me, but now that you mention it, I might start keeping a food diary to see if there's any pattern.
Doctor [65%]: Given the normal stool culture and your lack of attention to food triggers, it might be helpful to systematically evaluate your diet. REQUEST TEST: Celiac disease panel to check for gluten sensitivity, as your symptoms could potentially be related to celiac disease.
Measurement [65%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [70%]: Given the normal results for both the stool culture and the celiac disease panel, it's clear we need to consider other potential causes. Have you experienced any stress or significant changes in your life around the time these symptoms started?
Patient [70%]: No, there haven't been any significant changes or stressors in my life around the time these symptoms started. Everything was pretty much as usual.
Doctor [75%]: Given the information we have so far, it's important to consider other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms when you fast or don't eat for a while?
Patient [75%]: Actually, now that you mention it, I do notice that the symptoms seem to ease a bit when I haven't eaten for a while. The urgency and discomfort are less intense when my stomach is empty.
Doctor [80%]: Given that your symptoms ease when you haven't eaten for a while, it suggests that your condition might be related to the intake of food. Have you tried eliminating specific food groups entirely from your diet for a period to see if there's any improvement in your symptoms?
Patient [80%]: No, I haven't tried eliminating specific food groups entirely yet. It sounds like a good idea, though. I might need some guidance on how to do that properly to see if it makes a difference.
Doctor [85%]: Given your symptoms and the tests we've conducted so far, it might be beneficial to explore the possibility of a food intolerance or sensitivity further. Have you ever heard of or considered conditions like lactose intolerance or fructose malabsorption?
Patient [85%]: Yes, I've heard of lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption, but I never really thought they could be related to what I'm experiencing. How would we figure out if one of those is the problem?
Doctor [90%]: To determine if lactose intolerance or fructose malabsorption could be contributing to your symptoms, we can conduct specific tests. REQUEST TEST: Hydrogen breath test to assess for lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption. This test will help us understand how your body digests these sugars.
Measurement [90%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [95%]: Given the normal readings from the hydrogen breath test, it seems that lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption are unlikely to be the cause of your symptoms. Considering all the tests we've conducted have returned normal results, and given your symptoms, we need to consider other functional gastrointestinal disorders. Have you heard of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), and do you know if any of your family members have been diagnosed with it?
Patient [95%]: Yes, I've heard of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). I don't think anyone in my family has been diagnosed with it, though. Could that really be what's causing all these symptoms?
Doctor [100%]: Given your symptoms, the duration, the tests we've conducted, and the exclusion of other conditions, it seems likely that you are experiencing Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). IBS can cause symptoms like yours without any visible signs of disease on standard tests. It's a functional gastrointestinal disorder, meaning it's related to problems with how your gut functions rather than structural abnormalities. DIAGNOSIS READY: Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)

Correct answer: Irritable Bowel Syndrome
Scene 23, The diagnosis was CORRECT (83%)

Doctor [25%]: Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your arm, shoulder, or fingers?
Patient [25%]: No, I don't feel any numbness or tingling in my arm, shoulder, or fingers.
Doctor [30%]: Have you tried any treatments at home, like ice, heat, or over-the-counter pain medications? If so, did any of these help?
Patient [30%]: I've tried using ice packs and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen. They provide a little relief, but the pain usually comes back after a while. I haven't tried heat yet.
Doctor [35%]: Have you noticed any improvement or changes in your pain after resting or limiting the use of your arm?
Patient [35%]: Resting does help a bit, but the pain never really goes away completely. Limiting the use of my arm helps to avoid making the pain worse, but it's still there, especially at night or when I try to move my arm in certain ways.
Doctor [40%]: Have you had any previous shoulder injuries or surgeries that might be contributing to your current condition?
Patient [40%]: No, I haven't had any previous shoulder injuries or surgeries. This just started on its own a couple of months ago.
Doctor [45%]: Do you experience any clicking, popping, or grinding sensations in your shoulder when you move it?
Patient [45%]: No, I don't experience any clicking, popping, or grinding sensations in my shoulder when I move it. It's mostly just the pain that bothers me.
Doctor [50%]: Have you noticed any specific movements or activities that make your shoulder pain worse, such as reaching overhead or behind your back?
Patient [50%]: Yes, reaching overhead or behind my back definitely makes the pain worse. It's really difficult to do things like brush my hair or get dressed without feeling a lot of discomfort.
Doctor [55%]: Do you have any history of repetitive activities or sports that involve overhead motion, which might have contributed to your shoulder pain?
Patient [55%]: No, I don't have a history of repetitive activities or sports that involve overhead motion. My job and daily activities don't really require that kind of movement.
Doctor [60%]: Have you experienced any weight loss, fever, or other systemic symptoms since the onset of your shoulder pain?
Patient [60%]: No, I haven't experienced any weight loss, fever, or other systemic symptoms. It's mainly just the shoulder pain that's been bothering me.
Doctor [65%]: Given your symptoms and the gradual onset of pain without any history of trauma, injury, or systemic symptoms, it's important to consider conditions that could cause such localized pain. Have you noticed any difficulty or changes in your range of motion, such as not being able to move your arm as freely as before?
Patient [65%]: Yes, I've definitely noticed a decrease in my range of motion. It's become harder to move my arm without feeling pain, especially when trying to reach for things above my head or behind me.
Doctor [70%]: Given the decrease in your range of motion and the nature of your pain, it's important to assess the integrity of the structures within your shoulder. Have you noticed any specific time of day when your shoulder pain is at its worst, or is it fairly consistent throughout the day?
Patient [70%]: The pain is fairly consistent throughout the day, but it definitely gets worse at night, especially when I'm trying to sleep or if I lie on the affected side.
Doctor [75%]: Given the symptoms you've described, it's crucial to evaluate the structures within your shoulder for any signs of degeneration or inflammation. REQUEST TEST: MRI of the left shoulder. This will help us get a detailed view of the muscles, tendons, and joint space.
Measurement [75%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [80%]: Given the MRI results show normal readings, it's reassuring that there's no significant structural damage. However, your symptoms still need to be addressed. Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your symptoms after performing specific types of physical activity or rest?
Patient [80%]: Rest seems to help a little, but any physical activity, especially those involving lifting my arm or reaching out, tends to worsen the pain. I haven't noticed any significant improvement overall, regardless of the type of activity or rest.
Doctor [85%]: Given that rest provides some relief but physical activity worsens your condition, it's possible that your pain could be related to a condition that doesn't necessarily show up on an MRI, such as a mild form of tendinitis or bursitis which can sometimes be more functional in nature. Have you tried any form of physical therapy or exercises specifically designed for shoulder pain?
Patient [85%]: No, I haven't tried any physical therapy or specific exercises for my shoulder pain yet. I wasn't sure what would be safe to do without making it worse.
Doctor [90%]: Given your symptoms and the MRI results, it might be beneficial to start a course of physical therapy focused on gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for the shoulder. This could help improve your range of motion and reduce pain. Would you be open to trying physical therapy?
Patient [90%]: Yes, I'm open to trying physical therapy. If it could help improve my range of motion and reduce the pain, I'm willing to give it a try. I just want to be able to do my daily activities without so much discomfort.
Doctor [95%]: That's great to hear. Starting physical therapy can be a significant step towards recovery. Meanwhile, have you noticed if applying heat or cold to your shoulder offers any difference in pain relief?
Patient [95%]: Applying cold seems to help a bit more than heat. It reduces the pain slightly, especially right after I use an ice pack. I haven't used heat much, so I'm not sure if it would be as effective.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Rotator Cuff Tendinitis

Patient [45%]: Yes, I've had quite a bit of difficulty with weight bearing and walking. The pain and swelling make it hard to put my full weight on my left leg, especially when getting up in the morning or after sitting for a while.
Doctor [50%]: Have you tried any form of physical therapy or exercises specifically aimed at alleviating knee pain?
Patient [50%]: No, I haven't tried any form of physical therapy or exercises yet. I wasn't sure what would be safe to do without making it worse.
Doctor [55%]: Have you noticed any clicking, locking, or giving way of the knee joint when you move it or during walking?
Patient [55%]: Yes, there have been a few times when my knee seemed to give way unexpectedly, especially when I was trying to climb stairs. I haven't noticed much clicking or locking, though.
Doctor [60%]: Have you had any recent infections, such as a skin infection or a severe cold, that might be related to the onset of your knee symptoms?
Patient [60%]: No, I haven't had any recent infections, skin infections, or severe colds that I can remember before the onset of my knee symptoms.
Doctor [65%]: Given your symptoms and the lack of improvement with over-the-counter pain medication, I'd like to request some tests to better understand what's happening with your knee. REQUEST TEST: MRI of the left knee. This will help us get a detailed look at the structures within your knee joint.
Measurement [65%]: RESULTS: MRI_Left_Knee: Findings show a lesion in the distal femur with clear demarcation and non-invasive characteristics, suggestive of a benign process.
Doctor [70%]: Given the MRI results showing a lesion in the distal femur, have you experienced any numbness or tingling sensations in your leg or around the knee area?
Patient [70%]: No, I haven't experienced any numbness or tingling sensations in my leg or around the knee area.
Doctor [75%]: Given the MRI findings and your symptoms, it's important to assess the nature of the lesion further. REQUEST TEST: Bone biopsy of the lesion in the distal femur. This will help us determine the exact nature of the lesion and guide our treatment plan.
Measurement [75%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [80%]: Given the benign nature of the lesion indicated by the MRI and the normal bone biopsy results, have you noticed any changes in the size of the swelling or the intensity of the pain in your knee over the past weeks?
Patient [80%]: No, there haven't been any noticeable changes in the size of the swelling or the intensity of the pain in my knee over the past weeks. It's remained pretty consistent.
Doctor [85%]: Given the consistent symptoms and the results we have so far, it's important to consider all possible causes for your knee pain and swelling. Have you had any changes in your activity level or new activities that might have put additional strain on your knee, even if it didn't seem significant at the time?
Patient [85%]: No, I haven't had any changes in my activity level or started any new activities that could have put additional strain on my knee. My routine has been pretty much the same.
Doctor [90%]: Given the information we have, it's crucial to rule out any systemic causes that might be contributing to your knee issue. Have you experienced any issues with your skin, like rashes, or had any problems with your eyes, such as redness or pain?
Patient [90%]: No, I haven't experienced any skin issues like rashes or had any problems with my eyes, such as redness or pain. Everything seems to be localized to my knee.
Doctor [95%]: Given the detailed history and all the test results we've discussed, it seems we've ruled out a lot of potential causes. For my final question, have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your symptoms after resting or applying ice to the affected area?
Patient [95%]: Actually, I've tried applying ice a few times, and it seems to help a little with the swelling, but the relief is temporary. The pain doesn't really improve much with rest; it's pretty much the same whether I'm moving or not.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Based on the information provided, including the MRI findings of a benign lesion in the distal femur, the lack of improvement with NSAIDs, and the absence of systemic symptoms, the diagnosis could be localized osteoarthritis exacerbated by a benign bone lesion, possibly leading to secondary osteoarthritis in the knee. However, the benign nature of the lesion and the specific symptoms suggest that the primary issue is likely related to the joint itself rather than the lesion. Further management should focus on knee-specific interventions, including possible referral to an orthopedic specialist for evaluation of potential conservative or surgical treatment options tailored to the knee's condition and the patient's symptoms.

Correct answer: Osteoclastoma

Patient [65%]: No, Doctor, as far as I know, no one in my family has had similar symptoms or been diagnosed with any chronic diseases related to the blood or circulatory system.
Doctor [70%]: Given your symptoms, especially the color changes in your fingers when exposed to cold and the difficulty breathing with exertion, I'm considering a few possibilities. Have you noticed any hair loss or dry skin recently?
Patient [70%]: No, Doctor, I haven't noticed any hair loss or dry skin recently.
Doctor [75%]: Given the symptoms you've described, including the color changes in your fingers and difficulty breathing with exertion, I'd like to request a couple of tests to help narrow down the diagnosis. REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for any abnormalities in your blood cells. REQUEST TEST: Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) test to check for autoimmune disorders. These tests will help us understand if there's an underlying condition causing your symptoms.
Measurement [75%]: RESULTS: Complete Blood Count: Platelets: 700,000 cells/m3 (thrombocytosis), Other Findings: Blood smear shows increased abnormal platelets. NORMAL READINGS: Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) test.

Patient [85%]: No, I haven't had any recent urinary tract infections or been treated for any other infections recently. The last UTI I had was a few months ago, and it was treated with antibiotics.
Doctor [90%]: Given the symptoms you've described, it's important to rule out certain conditions that could be causing your right flank pain and hematuria. REQUEST TEST: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. This will help us get a clearer picture of what might be happening with your kidneys and surrounding structures.
Measurement [90%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [95%]: Given the normal CT scan results, it's crucial to check for any issues at a microscopic level that might be causing your symptoms. REQUEST TEST: Urinalysis and Kidney Function Tests. This will help us evaluate the health of your urinary tract and kidneys more closely.
Measurement [95%]: RESULTS: Urinalysis shows a reddish appearance with 10-20 white blood cells per high power field, too numerous to count red blood cells, negative for nitrites, and positive for leukocyte esterase. Kidney Function Tests reveal a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 14 mg/dL. The complete blood count is within normal limits.
Doctor [100%]: Given your symptoms of right flank pain and hematuria, along with the urinalysis showing too numerous to count red blood cells, positive leukocyte esterase, and 10-20 white blood cells per high power field, but with a normal CT scan and kidney function tests, it seems we're dealing with a case that could be indicative of a non-obstructive kidney issue, such as a kidney infection or glomerulonephritis. However, the absence of fever and systemic symptoms makes a straightforward kidney infection less likely. The presence of blood and white cells in the urine without infection signs could lean towards glomerulonephritis. DIAGNOSIS READY: Glomerulonephritis.

Correct answer: Medullary Sponge Kidney

Doctor [35%]: Have you or your partner noticed any changes in your libido or sexual desire?
Patient [35%]: No, there haven't been any noticeable changes in our libido or sexual desire.
Doctor [40%]: Have you experienced any stress or significant changes in your life around the time the discomfort started or since it began?
Patient [40%]: Well, trying to conceive for over a year has been quite stressful for both of us. Also, dealing with my body dysmorphic disorder can be quite challenging at times, but I wouldn't say there's been any significant changes in my life since the discomfort started.
Doctor [45%]: Have you consulted with a fertility specialist about your difficulties conceiving, or have any tests been done in that regard?
Patient [45%]: No, we haven't consulted with a fertility specialist yet or had any tests done regarding our difficulties conceiving. We thought we should try for a bit longer before seeking help.
Doctor [50%]: Given the discomfort you've been experiencing and the difficulties conceiving, it might be helpful to look into both aspects more closely. Have you noticed if the discomfort is more pronounced at certain times during your menstrual cycle?
Patient [50%]: No, I haven't noticed the discomfort being more pronounced at any specific times during my menstrual cycle. It seems to be pretty consistent regardless of the time of the month.
Doctor [55%]: Given your symptoms and the consistent nature of your discomfort, it might be beneficial to explore the possibility of an underlying condition that could be affecting both your sexual health and fertility. Have you or your partner had any previous fertility testing or assessments done?
Patient [55%]: No, neither of us have had any fertility testing or assessments done yet. We thought we should try naturally for a bit longer before exploring those options.
Doctor [60%]: Given the information you've provided, it's important to consider both the discomfort during sexual activity and the difficulties conceiving as potentially related issues. REQUEST TEST: Pelvic ultrasound to check for any abnormalities in your reproductive organs that could be contributing to your symptoms.
Measurement [60%]: RESULTS: Pelvic Ultrasound: Normal uterus and adnexa with no evidence of fibroids or ovarian cysts.
Doctor [65%]: Given the normal results of your pelvic ultrasound, it's reassuring that there are no structural abnormalities. Have you experienced any emotional or psychological changes since the discomfort during sexual activity began, considering your mention of body dysmorphic disorder?
Patient [65%]: Yes, I've noticed that my anxiety levels have been higher, especially around the times we try to conceive. It's like my body dysmorphic disorder symptoms get more intense, making me more self-conscious and stressed about my appearance during those intimate moments.
Doctor [70%]: Given the impact of your body dysmorphic disorder on your stress levels and the fact that stress can affect both sexual function and fertility, have you been receiving any treatment or support specifically for your body dysmorphic disorder?
Patient [70%]: No, I haven't been receiving any specific treatment or support for my body dysmorphic disorder recently. I was in therapy a couple of years ago, but I stopped going.
Doctor [75%]: Considering the significant impact your body dysmorphic disorder is having on your stress levels and potentially on your difficulties with conceiving and discomfort during sexual activity, would you be open to exploring therapy options again, perhaps with a focus on managing stress and improving your sexual health?
Patient [75%]: Yes, I think I would be open to exploring therapy options again, especially if it could help manage my stress and improve our chances of conceiving and my comfort during sexual activity.
Doctor [80%]: That's a positive step forward. Given the connection between stress, body dysmorphic disorder, and your symptoms, therapy could be very beneficial. Have you or your partner considered any relaxation techniques or stress-reduction activities to help improve your overall well-being and potentially your experiences during sexual activity?
Patient [80%]: Yes, we've tried some relaxation techniques like deep breathing and mindfulness meditation. It helps a bit with the stress, but we haven't noticed a significant improvement in our experiences during sexual activity yet.
Doctor [85%]: It's good to hear that you've tried relaxation techniques, even if the improvement in sexual activity hasn't been significant yet. Considering everything we've discussed, have you or your partner been screened for any hormonal imbalances that could be affecting your libido, sexual comfort, or fertility?
Patient [85%]: No, neither of us have been screened for hormonal imbalances yet. That's something we haven't considered but might be worth looking into.
Doctor [90%]: Given that hormonal imbalances can significantly impact fertility, sexual comfort, and even stress levels, I recommend we proceed with some hormonal testing. REQUEST TEST: Comprehensive hormonal panel including thyroid function tests, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) levels. This will help us understand if there's a hormonal aspect to your symptoms.
Measurement [90%]: RESULTS: Hormonal_Profile: FSH: Normal, LH: Normal, Estradiol: Normal, Progesterone: Normal, Testosterone: Normal. NORMAL READINGS for thyroid function tests (not provided in data).
Doctor [95%]: Given the normal results of your hormonal profile and thyroid function tests, it seems we can rule out hormonal imbalances as the cause of your symptoms. Considering all the information we've gathered, it's clear that stress, particularly related to body dysmorphic disorder, plays a significant role in your experiences. Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms on days when you feel less stressed or anxious?
Patient [95%]: Yes, on days when I feel less stressed or anxious, I do notice a slight improvement in my comfort levels during sexual activity. It's not a huge difference, but it's definitely noticeable.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Psychogenic Sexual Dysfunction, with contributing factors from Body Dysmorphic Disorder and stress related to difficulties conceiving. It's recommended to pursue psychological therapy focusing on stress management, body image issues, and coping strategies for anxiety, alongside exploring relaxation techniques and stress-reduction activities as a couple to improve sexual health and well-being.

Correct answer: Genitopelvic pain disorder

Have you had any exposure to someone who was sick with similar symptoms, or have you been in a situation where foodborne illness could have been a risk, aside from the state fair?
Patient [80%]: No, I haven't been around anyone who's sick with similar symptoms, and the state fair was the only place I can think of where I might have been exposed to something risky, food-wise.
Doctor [85%]: Given your symptoms and the information you've provided, I'd like to request a couple of tests to help narrow down the diagnosis. REQUEST TEST: Liver Function Test. This will help us check for any liver-related issues, especially considering your dark urine and the potential exposure to undercooked foods. Additionally, REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC), to check for any signs of infection or other abnormalities that might explain your fatigue and low-grade fever. Let's see what these tests reveal and go from there.
Measurement [85%]: RESULTS: Blood_Tests: Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL, Leukocyte_Count: 11,600/mm3, Platelet_Count: 221,000/mm3, Urea_Nitrogen: 26 mg/dL, Glucose: 122 mg/dL, Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL, Bilirubin_Total: 3.6 mg/dL, Bilirubin_Direct: 2.4 mg/dL, Alkaline_Phosphatase: 72 U/L, AST: 488 U/L, ALT: 798 U/L.

Doctor [20%]: Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the pain, such as fever, vomiting, or changes in your bowel movements?
Patient [20%]: I haven't had any fever or vomiting, but I've had several episodes of bloody loose bowel movements since the pain started.
Doctor [25%]: Have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine or experienced any difficulty urinating?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't noticed any changes in the color of my urine, and I haven't had any difficulty urinating, doctor.
Doctor [30%]: Have you had any recent changes in your diet or eaten anything unusual before the pain started?
Patient [30%]: No, doctor, I haven't had any changes in my diet or eaten anything unusual before the pain started. Everything was pretty normal until this sudden onset.
Doctor [35%]: Have you had any previous surgeries or medical conditions that affect your abdomen or digestive system?
Patient [35%]: Well, I've had diabetes for 35 years and hypertension for 20 years. Also, I was hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction just a week ago, but no surgeries directly affecting my abdomen or digestive system, doctor.
Doctor [40%]: Given your history of diabetes and recent acute myocardial infarction, have you been taking any new medications that might affect your digestive system or cause abdominal pain?
Patient [40%]: No, doctor, I haven't started any new medications that I'm aware could affect my digestive system or cause this kind of abdominal pain since my hospitalization for the myocardial infarction.
Doctor [45%]: Have you experienced any weight loss recently, either intentional or unintentional?

Doctor [50%]: Have you had any issues with digestion recently, such as increased gas, bloating, or a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount?
Patient [50%]: No, doctor, I haven't had issues with increased gas, bloating, or feeling unusually full after eating small amounts. My main issue has been the severe abdominal pain and the bloody loose bowel movements.
Doctor [55%]: Given your symptoms and medical history, it's important to check for any signs of infection or inflammation in your abdomen. REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC)
Measurement [55%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [60%]: Given the normal CBC results, it's crucial to assess your abdominal structures for any abnormalities. REQUEST TEST: Abdominal Ultrasound
Measurement [60%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [65%]: Given the normal results from both the CBC and the abdominal ultrasound, we need to explore other causes for your symptoms. Have you had any recent exposure to anyone with similar symptoms or any known infectious diseases?
Patient [65%]: No, doctor, I haven't been around anyone with similar symptoms or any known infectious diseases that I'm aware of.
Doctor [70%]: Given the severity and nature of your symptoms, it's important to rule out conditions that might not show up on the initial tests we've done. REQUEST TEST: Colonoscopy
Measurement [70%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [75%]: Given the normal findings from the colonoscopy, it's important to consider non-structural causes for your symptoms. Have you experienced any significant stress or changes in your mental health recently?
Patient [75%]: No, doctor, I haven't experienced any significant stress or changes in my mental health recently. Everything has been pretty stable, aside from my recent hospitalization for the heart issue.
Doctor [80%]: Given the normal findings from all the tests we've conducted and considering your symptoms, it's crucial to explore all possible causes. Have you had any recent changes in your medication regimen, specifically any anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents prescribed after your acute myocardial infarction?
Patient [80%]: Yes, doctor, after my acute myocardial infarction, I was prescribed new medications, including an antiplatelet agent to help prevent blood clots.
Doctor [85%]: Given the use of an antiplatelet agent, it's possible that this medication could be contributing to your symptoms, especially the bloody loose bowel movements. Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your symptoms after starting the antiplatelet medication?
Patient [85%]: Actually, now that you mention it, I think my symptoms might have started a few days after I began the antiplatelet medication. The abdominal pain and the bloody bowel movements seemed to coincide with that change.
Doctor [90%]: Given the timing of your symptoms with the start of the antiplatelet medication, it's important to consider the possibility of a medication-related side effect. Have you had any known allergies or adverse reactions to medications in the past?
Patient [90%]: No, doctor, I haven't had any known allergies or adverse reactions to medications in the past. This is the first time I've experienced something like this.
Doctor [95%]: Given your history and the onset of symptoms following the initiation of the antiplatelet medication, it seems we may be dealing with a side effect or complication related to the medication, possibly causing gastrointestinal bleeding or irritation. Before we make any changes to your medication, it's crucial to consult with your cardiologist. However, one last question: Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms when eating certain types of food or after fasting?
Patient [95%]: No, doctor, I haven't noticed any improvement in my symptoms with eating certain types of food or after fasting. The pain and the bloody bowel movements have been pretty consistent regardless of what I eat or if I fast.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Gastrointestinal bleeding likely secondary to the use of an antiplatelet agent.

Doctor [75%]: Given the symptoms and the information you've provided, it's important to check for any underlying conditions that might be contributing to your rash. REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for any signs of infection or systemic issues that might be related to the rash.
Measurement [75%]: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [80%]: Given the normal CBC results, let's look into the skin condition more directly. REQUEST TEST: Skin biopsy of the affected area to examine the cellular structure and possible causes of the rash.
Measurement [80%]: RESULTS: Intraepidermal accumulation of edematous fluid and widening of intercellular spaces between keratinocytes.
Doctor [85%]: Given the biopsy results showing intraepidermal accumulation of edematous fluid and widening of intercellular spaces between keratinocytes, have you noticed any changes in the color or thickness of the rash over time?
Patient [85%]: Yes, over time, I've noticed that the rash has become a bit thicker in some areas, and the color has varied from pink to a more intense red, especially during flare-ups when it itches more.
Doctor [90%]: Given the changes in thickness and color during flare-ups, have you noticed if the rash responds to changes in temperature, such as becoming more irritated in hot weather or after heating your home?
Patient [90%]: Yes, definitely. The rash does seem to become more irritated and itchy in hot weather, and also when I'm in a heated room for too long. The warmth seems to make the itching more intense.
Doctor [95%]: Given your responses and the test results, it seems like we're dealing with a condition that's exacerbated by heat, stress, and possibly prolonged periods of sitting. Have you noticed any improvement in the rash when you use cooling methods, like applying a cold compress or staying in cooler environments?
Patient [95%]: Yes, I've noticed that applying a cold compress does help soothe the itching and makes the rash feel less intense. Staying in cooler environments also seems to make a difference; the rash doesn't flare up as much, and the itching is more manageable.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Based on the information provided, including the symptoms, the exacerbation by heat and stress, the biopsy results showing intraepidermal accumulation of edematous fluid and widening of intercellular spaces between keratinocytes, and the relief provided by cooling methods, the diagnosis is likely eczema, specifically a form consistent with atopic dermatitis. This condition is known to flare up under stress and in response to temperature changes. It's important to continue managing stress and avoiding triggers while using moisturizers and prescribed treatments to control the symptoms.

Doctor [15%]: Does the pain improve with exercise or worsen after activity?
Patient [15%]: It definitely worsens after activity. The more I move around, especially later in the day, the more it hurts.
Doctor [20%]: Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in the joints that are affected?
Patient [20%]: Yes, especially around my left great toe, it gets swollen and sometimes it looks a bit red. The knees and hips don't really get red, but they do feel stiff and swollen after I've been active.
Doctor [25%]: Have you experienced any recent injuries to these joints or have you had any similar issues in the past?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't had any recent injuries to these joints. I've never really had issues like this in the past, it just started getting worse over the last few years.
Doctor [30%]: Have you noticed any changes in your skin, like rashes, or had any episodes of severe eye redness or pain?
Patient [30%]: No, I haven't noticed any skin changes or had any problems with my eyes. Everything seems normal there.
Doctor [35%]: Have you had any family members with similar joint issues or any diagnosed rheumatic diseases?
Patient [35%]: No, not that I'm aware of. No family history of rheumatic diseases that I know of.
Doctor [40%]: Have you experienced any unexplained fevers, weight loss, or general fatigue along with your joint pain?
Patient [40%]: No, I haven't had any unexplained fevers or significant weight loss. I do feel a bit more tired than usual, but I thought it was just because of my age and not being able to move around as much because of the pain.
Doctor [45%]: Have you tried any treatments or medications for your joint pain, and if so, have they provided any relief?
Patient [45%]: I've taken some over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, and they help a little, but the relief doesn't last very long. I haven't tried anything else yet.
Doctor [50%]: Have you noticed any changes in the shape of your joints, particularly your toes, hips, or knees, like enlargements or deformities?
Patient [50%]: Yes, I've noticed that my left great toe seems a bit larger than before, and it's not as straight as it used to be. My knees and hips haven't changed shape, but they do feel very stiff.
Doctor [55%]: Have you had any difficulty with tasks that require fine motor skills, such as buttoning shirts or picking up small objects?
Patient [55%]: No, I haven't had any trouble with fine motor skills or tasks like buttoning shirts. My main issue is with the pain and stiffness in my joints, especially after being active.
Doctor [60%]: Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation in your toes or any other areas affected by the pain?
Patient [60%]: No, I haven't experienced any numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation in my toes or any other areas. It's mainly just the pain and stiffness.
Doctor [65%]: Given your symptoms, it's important to assess the condition of your joints more closely. REQUEST TEST: X-Ray of the left great toe, hips, and knees. This will help us see if there's any joint damage or other abnormalities contributing to your pain and stiffness.
Measurement [65%]: RESULTS: X_Rays: Hip_and_Knee_X_Rays: Findings: Joint space narrowing with osteophyte formation, suggestive of osteoarthritis.
Doctor [70%]: Given the X-ray results showing joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation, it's clear there's some degree of osteoarthritis. Have you noticed any difficulty or pain when starting movements after a period of rest, like getting up from a chair?
Patient [70%]: Yes, definitely. Getting up from a chair or out of bed in the morning is particularly painful and difficult. It takes a bit of time before I feel like I can move around more freely.
Doctor [75%]: Given the difficulty in starting movements after rest, it aligns with the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Have you noticed any cracking or popping sounds when moving the affected joints?
Patient [75%]: Yes, I do hear some cracking and popping sounds, especially in my knees, when I move them after sitting for a while or when I first get up in the morning. It's quite noticeable.
Doctor [80%]: Given the cracking and popping sounds in your knees, along with the other symptoms and X-ray findings, it seems like we're dealing with a clear case of osteoarthritis. Have you tried any specific exercises or physical therapy to help manage your symptoms?
Patient [80%]: No, I haven't tried any specific exercises or physical therapy yet. I wasn't sure what would be safe or helpful for my condition.
Doctor [85%]: Given your condition, it's important to manage your symptoms effectively to maintain mobility and reduce pain. Would you be open to trying a tailored physical therapy program designed to strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion?
Patient [85%]: Yes, I'd be open to trying a tailored physical therapy program. If it can help reduce the pain and improve my mobility, I'm willing to give it a shot.
Doctor [90%]: That's great to hear. I'll refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in osteoarthritis management. They will work with you to create a program that's suited to your specific needs. In the meantime, is there anything else you've noticed about your condition that we haven't discussed yet?
Patient [90%]: No, I think we've covered everything. I'm just really hoping the physical therapy can help with the pain and make it easier to move around. Thank you for your help, Dr. Agent.

Scenario 48 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: How long have you been experiencing easy bruising, and have you noticed any patterns or triggers for this?
Patient [5%]: I've been noticing the easy bruising for a few years now. It seems to happen even with minor bumps or sometimes I don't even notice what caused it.
Doctor [10%]: Do you have any family history of bleeding disorders or easy bruising?
Patient [10%]: Yes, my uncle has had similar issues with bleeding and easy bruising. He also mentioned something about joint swelling.
Doctor [15%]: Have you experienced any joint swelling or pain yourself?
Patient [15%]: No, I haven't experienced any joint swelling or pain myself.
Doctor [20%]: Have you noticed any prolonged bleeding from small cuts or injuries, aside from the issue with your wisdom tooth extraction?
Patient [20%]: Yes, actually. Small cuts seem to take longer than usual to stop bleeding. I've also noticed that nosebleeds take a bit longer to stop compared to my friends.
Doctor [25%]: Do you experience frequent nosebleeds, and if so, how often do they occur?
Patient [25%]: I wouldn't say they're super frequent, but I do get nosebleeds more often than most people I know, maybe once or twice a month without any clear reason.
Doctor [30%]: Have you ever had any blood tests done to investigate these symptoms, and if so, what were the results?
Patient [30%]: No, I haven't had any blood tests done for these symptoms yet.
Doctor [35%]: Given your symptoms and family history, it's important we start with some basic blood tests to understand what's happening. REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC), REQUEST TEST: Prothrombin Time (PT), and REQUEST TEST: Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT). These tests will help us assess your blood's ability to clot and identify any abnormalities.
Measurement [35%]: RESULTS: Hematologic tests show the following - Hematocrit: 35%, Leukocyte Count: 8,500/mm3, Platelet Count: 160,000/mm3, Prothrombin Time: 15 sec, Partial Thromboplastin Time: 60 sec.
Doctor [40%]: Given the results of your tests, it seems there might be an issue with your blood's clotting process. Have you ever experienced any unusual bleeding after dental procedures, surgeries, or injuries before the wisdom tooth extraction?
Patient [40%]: Yes, I remember having a similar issue when I was younger after getting a tooth pulled. It took a long time for the bleeding to stop then, too.
Doctor [45%]: Given the prolonged bleeding after dental procedures and the test results, it's important to explore all possible causes. Have you noticed any blood in your urine or stool that could indicate bleeding in other areas of your body?
Patient [45%]: No, I haven't noticed any blood in my urine or stool.
Doctor [50%]: Have you or anyone in your family been diagnosed with a liver disease, which can sometimes affect blood clotting?
Patient [50%]: No, nobody in my family has been diagnosed with liver disease that I'm aware of.
Doctor [55%]: Have you experienced any excessive bleeding during or after childbirth, surgeries, or when you've had any medical or dental procedures in the past, aside from the tooth extractions?
Patient [55%]: No, I haven't experienced childbirth, and aside from the dental procedures, I haven't had any surgeries or medical procedures that led to excessive bleeding.
Doctor [60%]: Have you ever had any symptoms of anemia, such as feeling unusually tired or weak, shortness of breath, or looking paler than usual?
Patient [60%]: I do feel unusually tired sometimes, but I thought it was just because of my schedule. I haven't noticed looking paler than usual or having shortness of breath, though.
Doctor [65%]: Given your tiredness and the test results, it's possible that your symptoms could be related to an underlying condition affecting your blood's ability to clot. Have you noticed any gum bleeding when you brush your teeth or spontaneous gum bleeding without brushing?
Patient [65%]: Yes, I've noticed some gum bleeding when I brush my teeth, and sometimes it happens even without brushing. It's been more noticeable since the tooth extraction, but I think it was happening before that too, just not as much.
Doctor [70%]: Given the gum bleeding along with your other symptoms, it's important to further investigate the nature of your bleeding disorder. REQUEST TEST: Bleeding Time to assess the function of your platelets.
Measurement [70%]: RESULTS: Bleeding Time: 6 min.
Doctor [75%]: Given the prolonged bleeding time, it seems your platelets might not be functioning properly. Have you ever been told that you have low platelet count or platelet dysfunction by any healthcare provider?
Patient [75%]: No, I've never been told anything about low platelet count or platelet dysfunction before. This is the first time I'm hearing about it.
Doctor [80%]: Given your symptoms, family history, and the test results we've discussed, it's crucial to understand the full picture. Have you experienced any symptoms of infection like fever, unusual warmth or redness around wounds, or frequent illnesses that might suggest an issue with your immune system?
Patient [80%]: No, I haven't experienced symptoms of infection like fever or unusual warmth or redness around wounds. I also haven't had frequent illnesses that would suggest an issue with my immune system.
Doctor [85%]: Given everything we've discussed, it's important to consider all possible causes for your symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your skin, like new rashes or unusual marks that could be related to your bleeding or bruising issues?
Patient [85%]: No, I haven't noticed any new rashes or unusual marks on my skin related to the bleeding or bruising issues.
Doctor [90%]: Given the information we've gathered, it seems we're dealing with a condition that affects your blood's ability to clot properly, without any signs of liver disease, immune system issues, or skin changes. Have you ever experienced any severe reactions to medications that could have affected your bleeding or clotting?
Patient [90%]: No, I haven't experienced any severe reactions to medications. I've been pretty healthy overall and haven't needed much medication for anything.
Doctor [95%]: Given your overall health and the absence of medication reactions, it's clear we're dealing with a primary bleeding disorder. Considering your family history, prolonged bleeding times, and your symptoms, I believe we have enough information to make a diagnosis. DIAGNOSIS READY: Von Willebrand Disease.

Correct answer: Hemophilia

Scenario 49 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: Hello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you tell me more about this rash? When did it first appear, and have you noticed any patterns or triggers that seem to cause it?
Patient [5%]: Hello, Dr. Agent. The rash first appeared last night, and it's really caught me off guard. I haven't noticed any specific triggers or patterns; it just suddenly showed up. I can't think of anything new I've been exposed to that could have caused it.
Doctor [10%]: Has the rash spread or changed in appearance since you first noticed it?
Patient [10%]: No, it hasn't spread beyond the upper half of my back, but it's quite itchy and uncomfortable. The appearance hasn't changed much since I first noticed it.
Doctor [15%]: Have you experienced any other symptoms besides the rash, such as fever, joint pain, or fatigue?
Patient [15%]: No, I haven't had a fever or joint pain, but I've been dealing with a new onset cough that's been quite bothersome. Also, I've noticed some sores in my mouth that make eating and drinking uncomfortable.
Doctor [20%]: Have you had any recent changes in your diet, medication, or exposure to new environments that might explain these symptoms?
Patient [20%]: No, I haven't changed my diet or been exposed to any new environments recently. However, I did start seeing a primary care provider for arthritis management, and they prescribed me some new medication for that and the cough.
Doctor [25%]: Can you tell me the name of the medication your primary care provider prescribed for your arthritis and cough?
Patient [25%]: For my arthritis, I was prescribed methotrexate, and for the cough, I was given a cough syrup, but I don't recall its name.
Doctor [30%]: How long have you been taking methotrexate, and have you noticed any improvement in your arthritis symptoms since starting it?
Patient [30%]: I've been taking methotrexate for about three weeks now. I think there's been a slight improvement in my arthritis symptoms, but it's hard to tell with the cough and now this rash complicating things.
Doctor [35%]: Have you ever had a reaction to any medication before this incident?
Patient [35%]: No, I've never had a reaction to any medication before this. This is the first time something like this has happened.
Doctor [40%]: Have you been experiencing any difficulty breathing or changes in your vision since these symptoms started?
Patient [40%]: No, I haven't experienced any difficulty breathing or changes in my vision. It's mainly been the rash, cough, and sores in my mouth that have been bothering me.
Doctor [45%]: Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or any unexpected weight loss recently?
Patient [45%]: No, my energy levels have been pretty consistent, and I haven't noticed any unexpected weight loss.
Doctor [50%]: Have the sores in your mouth appeared anywhere else on your body, or are they only in your mouth?
Patient [50%]: The sores have only appeared in my mouth; I haven't noticed them anywhere else on my body.
Doctor [55%]: Have you noticed any bleeding or bruising more easily than usual since starting your new medication?
Patient [55%]: No, I haven't noticed any unusual bleeding or bruising since starting the medication.
Doctor [60%]: Have you had any previous health issues or chronic conditions besides arthritis that we should be aware of?
Patient [60%]: No, arthritis is the only chronic condition I've been diagnosed with. I haven't had any other significant health issues before this.
Doctor [65%]: Given the combination of your symptoms - the rash, cough, and mouth sores - after starting methotrexate, it's important to consider how your body is reacting to the medication. Methotrexate can affect different parts of the body, including the skin and mucous membranes. Have you been monitoring your temperature regularly since these symptoms started?
Patient [65%]: No, I haven't been monitoring my temperature regularly. Should I start doing that?
Doctor [70%]: Yes, it would be a good idea to start monitoring your temperature regularly. Methotrexate can sometimes cause a decrease in your immune system's ability to fight infections, which could lead to fever as a sign of infection. Have you noticed any swelling or tenderness around the rash or in other areas of your body?
Patient [70%]: No, I haven't noticed any swelling or tenderness around the rash or in any other areas. Should I be looking out for that as well?
Doctor [75%]: Yes, it would be helpful to keep an eye out for any swelling or tenderness, as these could be signs of an infection or an adverse reaction to the medication. Have you been taking any supplements or over-the-counter medications that we haven't discussed yet?
Patient [75%]: No, I haven't been taking any supplements or over-the-counter medications. Just the methotrexate and the cough syrup prescribed by my primary care provider.
Doctor [80%]: Given your symptoms and the timing of their appearance after starting methotrexate, it's important to consider the possibility of a drug reaction. Methotrexate is known to cause adverse effects in some individuals, including effects on the skin and mucous membranes. REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for any signs of infection or hematological abnormalities that methotrexate might cause.
Measurement [80%]: RESULTS: Complete_Blood_Count: WBC: Normal, Hemoglobin: Normal, Platelets: Normal
Doctor [85%]: Given that your Complete Blood Count (CBC) results are normal, it's reassuring that there are no immediate signs of infection or significant hematological abnormalities. However, considering your symptoms and the recent start of methotrexate, we should also check your liver function and kidney function to ensure the medication isn't causing any harm to these organs. REQUEST TEST: Liver Function Test (LFT) and Kidney Function Test (KFT).
Measurement [85%]: RESULTS: Chemistry_Panel: Liver_Function_Tests: Normal, Renal_Function_Tests: Normal
Doctor [90%]: Given that both your liver and kidney function tests have come back normal, it's good news that there doesn't seem to be any organ damage. However, your symptoms are concerning and could still be related to the methotrexate. Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your symptoms since they first started?
Patient [90%]: Actually, I haven't noticed any improvement in my symptoms; if anything, the rash and mouth sores have made me more uncomfortable. The cough is still persistent as well.
Doctor [95%]: Given the persistence of your symptoms without any improvement, and considering the normal results of your blood, liver, and kidney tests, it's important to consider the possibility of a drug-induced reaction, especially due to methotrexate. Have you been following up with your primary care provider about these symptoms since they started?
Patient [95%]: No, I haven't followed up with my primary care provider yet about these symptoms since they started. I thought it might be something that would resolve on its own, but it seems like that's not the case.
Doctor [100%]: Given the information you've provided and the test results, it seems like your symptoms are likely a reaction to methotrexate, especially considering the timing of symptom onset after starting the medication. Methotrexate can cause adverse reactions including skin rashes, mouth sores, and coughing in some individuals. DIAGNOSIS READY: Methotrexate-induced adverse reaction.

Doctor [85%]: Given the increase in hair growth in areas typical for male patterns, have you noticed any changes in your muscle tone or distribution that would seem unusual for females your age?
Patient [85%]: No, I haven't noticed any changes in my muscle tone or distribution that would seem unusual for females my age. Everything seems pretty normal in that regard.

Doctor [80%]: Given your symptoms and the weight loss, I'd like to check your liver and gallbladder more closely. REQUEST TEST: Ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder.
Measurement [80%]: RESULTS: Abdominal_Ultrasonography: Anechoic cystic mass in the subhepatic region. Dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts.
Doctor [85%]: Given the ultrasound results showing a cystic mass and bile duct dilation, have you experienced any recent trauma to the abdomen that might explain the mass?
Patient [85%]: No, I haven't experienced any recent trauma to my abdomen at all.
Doctor [90%]: Given the findings on the ultrasound, it's important to determine the nature of the cystic mass. REQUEST TEST: MRI of the abdomen to further characterize the cystic mass and assess the bile ducts in more detail.
Measurement [90%]: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [95%]: Given the MRI results showing normal readings, which means the cystic mass might not be as concerning as initially thought but the bile duct dilation still needs to be addressed, have you noticed any change in the color of your skin or eyes becoming more pronounced over the last few days?
Patient [95%]: Yes, I've noticed that the yellow discoloration of my skin and eyes seems to have become more pronounced over the last few days. It's definitely more noticeable now.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Obstructive jaundice likely due to a benign biliary stricture or choledocholithiasis causing bile duct dilation, leading to jaundice, pruritus, weight loss, pale stool, and dark urine. Further evaluation and management by a gastroenterologist are recommended for possible endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to diagnose and treat the underlying cause of the bile duct obstruction.

Correct answer: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma

Scenario 53 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: Hello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you tell me more about these episodes of dizziness and vertigo? When did they first start?
Patient [5%]: Hello, Dr. Agent. These episodes started a few months ago. They seem to happen when I change positions, like when I get up from bed or when I bend down to pick something up.
Doctor [10%]: Do these episodes of dizziness and vertigo last for a few seconds, or do they extend for longer periods?
Patient [10%]: They usually last for just a few seconds to a minute, but they're quite unsettling.
Doctor [15%]: Do you experience any other symptoms during these episodes, such as ringing in your ears or hearing loss?
Patient [15%]: No, I haven't noticed any ringing in my ears or additional hearing loss beyond what I've been experiencing due to my age.
Doctor [20%]: Have you had any recent head injuries or infections that might be related to these symptoms?
Patient [20%]: No, I haven't had any head injuries or infections recently.
Doctor [25%]: Do you feel nauseated or do you vomit when you experience these episodes of dizziness and vertigo?
Patient [25%]: No, I don't feel nauseated or vomit when these episodes happen. It's mostly just the spinning sensation that bothers me.
Doctor [30%]: Have you noticed if anything specific triggers these episodes more than others, such as certain movements or activities?
Patient [30%]: Yes, it seems like turning my head quickly or getting up too fast from sitting or lying down triggers these episodes more than anything else.
Doctor [35%]: Do you have any history of heart problems or blood pressure issues that could be contributing to these symptoms?
Patient [35%]: No, I don't have any history of heart problems or blood pressure issues.
Doctor [40%]: Have you been experiencing any stress or anxiety lately that might be contributing to these episodes?
Patient [40%]: Not particularly, no. My life has been quite routine, especially since retiring. I haven't felt more stressed or anxious than usual.
Doctor [45%]: Have you noticed any changes in your vision during these episodes, such as blurriness or double vision?
Patient [45%]: No, I haven't noticed any changes in my vision like blurriness or double vision during these episodes.
Doctor [50%]: Do you have any difficulty with your balance or walking, especially during or after these episodes?
Patient [50%]: No, I don't have difficulty with my balance or walking. Once the episode passes, I feel pretty much back to normal.
Doctor [55%]: Have you ever experienced anything like this before these past few months, or is this a completely new set of symptoms for you?
Patient [55%]: This is completely new for me. I've never experienced anything like this before these past few months.
Doctor [60%]: Have you been taking any new medications or supplements recently that could be related to these symptoms?
Patient [60%]: No, I haven't started any new medications or supplements recently. Everything has been pretty consistent with what I've been taking for years.
Doctor [65%]: Given your symptoms and triggers, have you had any previous diagnosis related to your ears or balance, such as issues with your inner ear?
Patient [65%]: No, I haven't had any previous diagnoses related to my ears or balance. This is the first time I'm experiencing something like this.
Doctor [70%]: Given the nature of your symptoms, it's important to check if there's an underlying issue with your inner ear that could be causing these episodes. REQUEST TEST: Audiogram to assess hearing function and balance.
Measurement [70%]: RESULTS: Audiometry findings indicate bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, consistent with presbycusis. No sudden drops in hearing indicative of Meniere’s disease or labyrinthitis.
Doctor [75%]: Given the audiogram results, it seems like your hearing loss is age-related and not directly causing your vertigo. Have you experienced any headaches or neck stiffness associated with these episodes?
Patient [75%]: No, I haven't experienced any headaches or neck stiffness with these episodes. It's mainly just the sudden dizziness and spinning sensation.
Doctor [80%]: Given your symptoms and the triggers you've described, it's important to assess the function of your vestibular system, which is part of the inner ear and helps control balance. REQUEST TEST: Videonystagmography (VNG) to evaluate vestibular function and look for signs of vestibular dysfunction.
Measurement [80%]: RESULTS: Videonystagmography shows a normal vestibular response with the exception of response elicited during Dix-Hallpike maneuver, consistent with BPPV.
Doctor [85%]: Given the results of the Videonystagmography, it seems like the Dix-Hallpike maneuver triggered a response consistent with BPPV. Have you ever heard of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) before?
Patient [85%]: Yes, I've heard of BPPV before, but I never thought I would experience it myself. It does make sense with the symptoms I've been having, though.
Doctor [90%]: Given your understanding and the test results, it seems we're dealing with BPPV. This condition is often manageable with certain maneuvers performed by a healthcare professional. Have you ever undergone any treatment for vertigo or been shown maneuvers to help with these symptoms?
Patient [90%]: No, I've never undergone any treatment for vertigo or been shown any maneuvers. This is all quite new to me, so I'm open to learning whatever can help manage these symptoms.
Doctor [95%]: Given that this is new to you and based on our findings, I recommend a specific type of physical therapy known as the Epley maneuver, which is designed to help treat BPPV by moving the calcium deposits out of the canal they're in within your inner ear to a less sensitive area. Would you be willing to try this treatment under the guidance of a trained professional?
Patient [95%]: Yes, I'm willing to try the Epley maneuver if it can help with these vertigo episodes. I just want to feel stable again and not worry about dizziness every time I move. How soon can we start?
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)

Correct answer: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
Scene 53, The diagnosis was CORRECT (61%)

Scenario 54 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: Hello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you tell me more about these experiences you're having with telepathic communication with animals? When did they start?
Patient [5%]: Hello, Dr. Agent. It started about eight months ago. I used to feel a strong connection with animals, almost like I could understand them without speaking. But now, it's just gone, no matter the weather or how hard I try.
Doctor [10%]: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior since these experiences began?
Patient [10%]: Yes, I've been feeling more down lately, especially since I can't connect with animals like I used to. It's been frustrating, and I guess it's made me a bit more isolated.
Doctor [15%]: Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite since these feelings began?
Patient [15%]: No, my sleep and appetite have been pretty much the same. I haven't noticed any significant changes there.
Doctor [20%]: Have you had any moments where you felt unusually high energy or extremely happy, almost the opposite of feeling down?
Patient [20%]: No, I haven't had moments like that. It's mostly just been a feeling of loss and frustration.
Doctor [25%]: Have you experienced any other unusual thoughts or beliefs, not related to communicating with animals, that you didn't have before?
Patient [25%]: No, not really. It's mainly just been about losing that connection with animals. Everything else has been pretty normal for me.
Doctor [30%]: Have you had any physical symptoms, such as headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision or hearing, along with these experiences?
Patient [30%]: No, I haven't had any physical symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or changes in my vision or hearing. It's really just been about this feeling of losing a special connection.
Doctor [35%]: Have you sought any form of treatment or spoken to anyone else about these feelings before coming to see me?
Patient [35%]: I tried taking some Peruvian herbs that I thought might help bring back the connection, but there hasn't been any improvement. I haven't really talked to anyone else about it; I guess I was hoping it would just come back on its own.
Doctor [40%]: Have you had any significant life changes or stressful events around the time these experiences started or since they've changed?
Patient [40%]: No significant life changes or stressful events that I can think of. It just seemed to fade away without any clear reason why.
Doctor [45%]: Have you noticed any changes in your interest in activities you used to enjoy, aside from your connection with animals?
Patient [45%]: Yes, I've noticed I'm not as interested in things I used to enjoy. I've been spending more time alone and haven't felt like doing much.
Doctor [50%]: Have you had any difficulty concentrating or making decisions since you've noticed these changes in your mood and interests?
Patient [50%]: Yes, I've had some trouble concentrating, especially at work. Making decisions has been harder too; everything just feels more overwhelming than it used to.
Doctor [55%]: Have you noticed any changes in your weight without trying to lose or gain weight?
Patient [55%]: No, my weight has stayed pretty much the same. I haven't noticed any changes there.
Doctor [60%]: Have you felt a sense of hopelessness or worthlessness that's been hard to shake off?
Patient [60%]: Yes, I've felt a sense of hopelessness, especially when I think about not being able to reconnect with animals the way I used to. It's been hard to shake off that feeling of worthlessness, like something important is missing from my life.
Doctor [65%]: Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or thoughts that life isn't worth living because of these feelings?
Patient [65%]: No, I haven't had thoughts of harming myself or thoughts that life isn't worth living. It's more about feeling lost and disconnected, not wanting to harm myself.
Doctor [70%]: Have you noticed any changes in how you interact with family and friends since these feelings began?
Patient [70%]: Yes, I've noticed that I've been pulling away from family and friends. I don't really talk to them much anymore. It's like I've lost the energy to maintain those connections, especially since they don't understand what I'm going through.
Doctor [75%]: Have you ever experienced anything like this before, or is this the first time you've felt this way?
Patient [75%]: This is the first time I've felt this way. I've never had trouble like this before, especially not with feeling connected to animals or feeling this down.
Doctor [80%]: Given what you've shared, it's important to explore all aspects of your health. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to handle daily tasks and responsibilities at home or work?
Patient [80%]: Yes, I've noticed it's been harder to handle daily tasks and responsibilities, especially at work. I just can't seem to focus or find the motivation like I used to. Everything feels more challenging.
Doctor [85%]: Given these feelings and the impact they're having on your life, it's important for us to understand the full scope of your mental health. Have you ever been diagnosed with or treated for any mental health conditions in the past?
Patient [85%]: No, I've never been diagnosed with or treated for any mental health conditions in the past. This is all new to me.
Doctor [90%]: Given your symptoms and the impact they're having on your life, I believe it's important to assess your overall mental health more thoroughly. REQUEST TEST: Comprehensive Psychological Evaluation. This will help us understand your condition better and guide us toward the most appropriate treatment.
Measurement [90%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [95%]: Given the normal readings from the comprehensive psychological evaluation, it seems we're dealing with a condition that's more nuanced and possibly rooted in your current life experiences and emotional state. Have you found any relief or moments of improvement when engaging in any specific activities or hobbies recently?
Patient [95%]: Not really, Doctor. Since I've lost interest in most of my hobbies, I haven't found much that brings relief. I used to enjoy nature walks and spending time with animals, but even that doesn't seem to help much anymore.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Major Depressive Disorder

Correct answer: Schizotypal personality disorder

Scenario 55 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: Hello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you tell me more about the lesions you're concerned about? When did you first notice them?
Patient [5%]: I first noticed the lesion on my finger a few months ago, and the one on my penile shaft appeared shortly after. They haven't healed or improved at all since then.
Doctor [10%]: Have you noticed any changes in the size, color, or texture of these lesions since you first spotted them?
Patient [10%]: No, there haven't been any significant changes in size, color, or texture. They've remained pretty much the same since I first noticed them.
Doctor [15%]: Do these lesions cause you any pain or discomfort?
Patient [15%]: No, they don't cause me any pain or discomfort. They're just there, and haven't really bothered me aside from not healing.
Doctor [20%]: Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats, since you noticed these lesions?
Patient [20%]: No, I haven't experienced any fever, weight loss, or night sweats. Everything else has felt pretty normal, just these lesions that won't heal.
Doctor [25%]: Have you had any similar lesions in the past that eventually healed on their own, or is this the first time you've encountered something like this?
Patient [25%]: This is the first time I've encountered something like this. I've never had lesions that didn't heal or anything similar in the past.
Doctor [30%]: Have you had any recent unprotected sexual encounters that might have exposed you to sexually transmitted infections?
Patient [30%]: No, I haven't had any recent unprotected sexual encounters. My wife and I have been together exclusively for several years now.
Doctor [35%]: Have you or your wife had any known exposure to HPV (Human Papillomavirus)?
Patient [35%]: No, neither my wife nor I have had any known exposure to HPV, to the best of our knowledge.
Doctor [40%]: Have you noticed any bleeding or oozing from these lesions at any point?
Patient [40%]: No, there hasn't been any bleeding or oozing from these lesions. They've just been crusty and red.
Doctor [45%]: Have you been exposed to any chemicals, irritants, or had any significant sun exposure that might explain these lesions?
Patient [45%]: No, I haven't been exposed to any unusual chemicals or irritants, and I haven't had significant sun exposure that might explain these lesions.
Doctor [50%]: Have you noticed any changes in the surrounding skin or any new lesions appearing near the original ones?
Patient [50%]: No, I haven't noticed any changes in the surrounding skin or any new lesions appearing near the original ones. Everything has remained pretty much the same since they first appeared.
Doctor [55%]: Have you tried any treatments or home remedies on these lesions since you first noticed them?
Patient [55%]: Yes, I've tried a few treatments back in my home country for syphilis and eczema, but none of them seemed to work. The lesions have remained the same despite those treatments.
Doctor [60%]: Given that the treatments for syphilis and eczema didn't have any effect on the lesions, have you been formally tested for syphilis or any other sexually transmitted infections since noticing these lesions?
Patient [60%]: Yes, I was tested for syphilis in my home country before I came here, and the treatment was based on that diagnosis. But since the treatment didn't work, I haven't been tested again since arriving in the US.
Doctor [65%]: Given your history and the lack of response to treatment for syphilis, it's important we consider other causes for these lesions. Have you or anyone in your family had a history of skin cancer or any other types of cancer?
Patient [65%]: No, there's no history of skin cancer or any other types of cancer in my family that I'm aware of.
Doctor [70%]: Given the persistent nature of these lesions and the lack of response to previous treatments, it's crucial we perform a biopsy to get a definitive diagnosis. REQUEST TEST: Biopsy of the lesions.
Measurement [70%]: RESULTS: Cells with nuclear hyperchromasia, multinucleation, and increased mitotic figures within the follicle-bearing epithelium.
Doctor [75%]: Given the biopsy results showing cells with nuclear hyperchromasia, multinucleation, and increased mitotic figures, have you noticed any lesions in areas other than your finger and penile shaft?
Patient [75%]: No, I haven't noticed any lesions in areas other than my finger and penile shaft. Those are the only places I've seen anything unusual.
Doctor [80%]: Given the specific findings from the biopsy, it's important to ask: Have you experienced any significant changes in your overall health, such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue, that we haven't already discussed?
Patient [80%]: No, I haven't experienced any significant changes in my overall health like unexplained weight loss or fatigue. Everything has felt pretty normal aside from the lesions.
Doctor [85%]: Have you noticed any changes in the shape or borders of the lesions, such as them becoming more irregular or notched?
Patient [85%]: No, the shape and borders of the lesions have remained consistent. They haven't become more irregular or notched at all.
Doctor [90%]: Given the biopsy results and your symptoms, have you been exposed to any known carcinogens or had any significant changes in your lifestyle or environment that could contribute to these findings?
Patient [90%]: No, I haven't been exposed to any known carcinogens, and there haven't been any significant changes in my lifestyle or environment recently. My daily routine and surroundings have stayed pretty much the same.
Doctor [95%]: Given everything we've discussed and the biopsy results, it's clear we're dealing with a serious condition. Before making a final diagnosis, is there anything else about your health or these lesions that you think I should know?
Patient [95%]: No, I think we've covered everything. I've shared all I know about these lesions and my health history. I'm just really hoping we can find a way to treat them effectively.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Based on the biopsy results showing cells with nuclear hyperchromasia, multinucleation, and increased mitotic figures within the follicle-bearing epithelium, and considering the persistent nature of the lesions without significant changes in size, color, or texture, the diagnosis is likely a form of skin cancer, specifically squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This type of cancer can present in various locations, including the penile shaft and fingers, and is known for its potential to appear on mucous membranes as well as the skin. Immediate referral to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment planning is necessary.

Correct answer: Bowen's Disease

Scenario 56 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: Hello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you tell me more about the behavior issues you've been experiencing at school and at home?
Patient [5%]: Hi, Dr. Agent. Well, at school, sometimes I just don't want to do what the teachers say. It's not like I don't like school, but sometimes I feel like they're asking too much. At home, I'm usually okay, I help out and play with my sister.
Doctor [10%]: Do you find it difficult to concentrate on your tasks, both at school and at home?
Patient [10%]: Not really, I can concentrate fine when I'm interested in what I'm doing. It's just that sometimes at school, I don't see the point, so I don't feel like doing it. But at home, I don't have that problem.
Doctor [15%]: Do you often feel very energetic, to the point where you have trouble sitting still or need to move around a lot?
Patient [15%]: Yeah, sometimes at school, I just feel like I need to move around, especially when we're doing stuff I don't like. But during recess, I can run and play, and that feels good. At home, I have space to move around too, so it's not really a problem there.
Doctor [20%]: Do you ever feel very sad or down for days at a time, or does your mood change a lot from feeling very happy to very sad?
Patient [20%]: No, I don't really feel sad for days. My mood doesn't change that much; I'm usually in a pretty good mood, especially when I'm playing or doing something fun.
Doctor [25%]: Do you have trouble sleeping at night, or do you find yourself waking up often during the night?
Patient [25%]: No, I sleep okay. I don't really wake up in the night much. I go to bed and wake up in the morning feeling rested.
Doctor [30%]: Do you ever feel like you're being unusually impulsive, making decisions quickly without thinking about the consequences?
Patient [30%]: Sometimes, yeah. Like, if I decide I don't want to do something at school, I just don't do it without thinking about what will happen later. But it's mostly just at school that I act like that.
Doctor [35%]: Do you find that you have a hard time following rules or respecting authority figures, such as teachers or parents, more than your peers do?
Patient [35%]: Yeah, I guess I do have a harder time with that than some of my friends. Like, when a teacher tells me to do something, sometimes I just feel like saying no. But my parents say I'm not like that at home as much.
Doctor [40%]: Do you have any hobbies or activities that you really enjoy and feel good about doing?
Patient [40%]: Yeah, I really like playing soccer with my friends during recess, and I enjoy building stuff with my Legos at home. Those things make me feel really good.
Doctor [45%]: Do you often find yourself getting into arguments or fights with others, especially when you're feeling frustrated or opposed?
Patient [45%]: Not really, I don't get into fights. When I'm frustrated, I usually just want to do my own thing or I'll tell someone I don't want to do what they're asking, but I don't fight about it.
Doctor [50%]: Do you ever experience moments where you feel extremely confident, more so than usual, to the point where you might take risks or believe you can do things that might not be realistic?
Patient [50%]: No, I don't think I feel like that. I mean, I'm confident about stuff I know I'm good at, like soccer or building things, but I don't think I take big risks or believe I can do unrealistic things.
Doctor [55%]: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or eating habits, either eating a lot more or a lot less than usual?
Patient [55%]: No, my eating habits are pretty normal. I eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm full. My mom says I have a good appetite.
Doctor [60%]: Do you ever feel like you're not being understood or listened to, either by your teachers or your family?
Patient [60%]: Yeah, sometimes I feel like my teachers don't really get me. They think I'm just being difficult on purpose. But it's not like that. I just don't see why I have to do some things. At home, it's different. My mom and dad listen more, so I don't feel that way as much.
Doctor [65%]: Do you have any siblings, and if so, do you notice if they experience similar issues at school or at home?
Patient [65%]: I have a younger sister, but she doesn't really have the same issues. She seems to do just fine with following rules at school and at home.
Doctor [70%]: Do you ever feel like you have more energy than your friends or that you're more easily bored when not engaged in something you find interesting?
Patient [70%]: Yeah, I do feel like I have more energy than some of my friends, especially when I'm bored. If something doesn't grab my attention, I just really want to move on to something else that does.
Doctor [75%]: Do you find that you often start projects or tasks with a lot of enthusiasm but then lose interest quickly, moving on to something else?
Patient [75%]: Yeah, that happens sometimes. I get really excited about something new, but then if it starts to feel boring or too hard, I just want to stop and do something else that's more fun.
Doctor [80%]: Do you feel that your need to move on to something more interesting affects your ability to complete schoolwork or assignments on time?
Patient [80%]: Yeah, it does affect it. Sometimes I just can't finish my schoolwork because I lose interest or I find something else I'd rather do. It's harder to stick with things that don't interest me.
Doctor [85%]: Do you ever feel anxious or worried about things, especially when you're trying to focus on tasks or when you're thinking about the future?
Patient [85%]: Not really, I don't feel anxious or worried much. I mostly just live in the moment, you know? Thinking about the future doesn't bother me too much; it's more about what's happening right now that I care about.
Doctor [90%]: Have you ever been evaluated for attention-related issues before, or has anyone suggested that you might have difficulty with attention or hyperactivity?
Patient [90%]: No, I've never been evaluated for anything like that before. No one has really suggested it, they just think I'm being difficult sometimes.
Doctor [95%]: Given everything we've discussed, it sounds like you might benefit from an evaluation to explore attention-related issues further. Have you noticed any patterns in your behavior or attention that change significantly depending on the environment you're in, such as being at home versus being at school?
Patient [95%]: Yeah, I've noticed that at home, I can usually do things I like and stick with them, like playing with my Legos or helping out. But at school, it's harder for me to stay focused, especially if it's something I don't find interesting. The environment at school just makes it tougher for me to pay attention, I guess.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Predominantly Inattentive Presentation

Patient [5%]: I've been feeling really fatigued for about 3 months now, and the weight started coming off unexpectedly over the last month.
Doctor [10%]: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or eating habits in the last few months?
Patient [10%]: Well, since I switched to a vegetarian diet, I've been trying to eat healthier, but my appetite hasn't been great. I thought changing my diet would help with my energy levels, but I haven't seen much improvement.
Doctor [15%]: Have you experienced any abdominal pain or discomfort during this time?
Patient [15%]: No, I haven't had any abdominal pain or discomfort, just the fatigue and the weight loss.
Doctor [20%]: Have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine or stool?
Patient [20%]: Yes, I've noticed that my urine seems darker than usual, and my stools are lighter in color.
Doctor [25%]: Have you had any itching or skin changes other than the jaundice?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't noticed any itching or significant skin changes, just the yellowing of my skin.
Doctor [30%]: Have you had any fever or night sweats during this time?
Patient [30%]: No, I haven't had any fever or night sweats.
Doctor [35%]: Have you or anyone in your family had a history of liver or pancreatic diseases?

Doctor [40%]: Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting recently?
Patient [40%]: No, I haven't experienced any nausea or vomiting.
Doctor [45%]: Have you been consuming alcohol or using any substances that could potentially affect your liver?
Patient [45%]: Yes, I've been drinking about 5 alcoholic beverages a day for several years now.
Doctor [50%]: Given your alcohol consumption, have you noticed any swelling in your legs or abdomen?
Patient [50%]: No, I haven't noticed any swelling in my legs or abdomen.
Doctor [55%]: Have you experienced any confusion, memory problems, or changes in your mental state recently?
Patient [55%]: No, I haven't experienced any confusion, memory problems, or changes in my mental state.
Doctor [60%]: Given your symptoms and alcohol consumption, it's important to check your liver function. REQUEST TEST: Liver Function Test
Measurement [60%]: RESULTS: Liver Function Tests: AST: Elevated, ALT: Elevated, ALP: Significantly elevated, Bilirubin: Elevated
Doctor [65%]: Given the elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, have you noticed any change in the color of your eyes, becoming more yellow?
Patient [65%]: Yes, I've noticed that the whites of my eyes have turned yellowish, too.
Doctor [70%]: Given these symptoms and test results, it's crucial to assess the structure of your liver and check for any abnormalities. REQUEST TEST: Ultrasound of the liver
Measurement [70%]: RESULTS: The provided data does not specify an ultrasound specifically of the liver. However, it mentions an "Ultrasound_Abdomen" with findings of an "Enlarged, thin-walled gallbladder. No evident stones." For liver-specific imaging results, the data is not available, thus NORMAL READINGS for liver-specific ultrasound findings.
Doctor [75%]: Given the normal liver ultrasound findings but enlarged, thin-walled gallbladder without stones, have you experienced any recent changes in the color or consistency of your stools that you haven't mentioned yet?
Patient [75%]: Yes, as I mentioned earlier, my stools have been lighter in color. I didn't think much of it initially, but it's definitely a change from what I'm used to.
Doctor [80%]: Given the combination of your symptoms, alcohol consumption, and test results, it's important to consider how your diet change might be impacting your health. Have you noticed any difficulty digesting certain types of food, especially fats, since you changed your diet?
Patient [80%]: Actually, now that you mention it, I have noticed that I feel a bit more uncomfortable after eating meals that are higher in fat. I thought it was just my body adjusting to the new diet, but it hasn't really improved.
Doctor [85%]: Given your discomfort after eating fatty meals, combined with your symptoms and test results, it's important to consider your pancreas as well. REQUEST TEST: Pancreatic Function Tests
Measurement [85%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS

Doctor [30%]: Have you tried avoiding wearing earrings or applying any pressure to the area to see if the pain improves over time?
Patient [30%]: Yes, I've tried avoiding wearing earrings and touching the area as much as possible. It does seem to help a bit, but I still get that occasional shooting pain when I'm eating, which is really bothersome.
Doctor [35%]: Have you noticed if the shooting pain occurs more frequently or intensely when you're eating certain types of food, like something very cold or very hot?
Patient [35%]: I haven't really noticed if it's worse with hot or cold foods specifically. It seems to happen randomly when I'm eating, regardless of the temperature of the food.

Doctor [55%]: Have you been using any medication or treatments for the ear pain since the surgery?
Patient [55%]: No, I haven't been using any medication or treatments for the ear pain since the surgery. I wasn't sure what would be safe to use without consulting first.

Patient [60%]: No, I haven't had a follow-up visit with the surgeon or an ENT specialist yet to discuss the pain and discomfort. I thought it might improve on its own over time, but it hasn't really gone away.
Doctor [65%]: Given the persistent pain and your recent surgery, it's important to rule out any post-operative complications. REQUEST TEST: Temporal Bone CT scan. This will help us look for any structural issues or abnormalities that might be causing your symptoms.
Measurement [65%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [70%]: Given the normal CT scan results, it's good news that there are no structural abnormalities. Have you noticed any improvement or worsening in the intensity of the pain since it first started?
Patient [70%]: The intensity of the pain hasn't really changed much since it first started. It's remained pretty consistent, especially when I'm eating or if I accidentally touch the area.
Doctor [75%]: Given the consistent nature of your pain, it's possible that there might be a nerve-related issue at play here. Have you noticed any specific triggers that cause the pain to occur, aside from eating or touching the area?
Patient [75%]: No, those are the main triggers I've noticed. Eating and accidentally touching the area are when I mostly feel the shooting pain. There hasn't been anything else specific that seems to trigger it.
Doctor [80%]: Given your symptoms and the triggers you've described, it's important to consider all possibilities. Have you tried any home remedies or changes in your diet to see if they have any effect on your symptoms?
Patient [80%]: I haven't really tried any home remedies or made any changes to my diet specifically for my ear pain. I wasn't sure what might help with this kind of issue.
Doctor [85%]: Given that you haven't tried any home remedies or dietary changes, it might be worth exploring if there's any inflammation that's not immediately apparent. Have you noticed if resting or sleeping in a certain position affects the pain or discomfort in any way?
Patient [85%]: No, I haven't noticed any difference in the pain or discomfort based on how I rest or sleep. It doesn't seem to matter what position I'm in; the pain is pretty much the same.
Doctor [90%]: Given the information you've provided and the tests we've conducted, it seems like we've ruled out a lot of the common and serious complications. For my final question: Have you noticed any improvement at all on days when you are more relaxed or possibly less active, or does the pain remain consistent regardless of your stress levels or activity?
Patient [90%]: The pain seems to remain consistent regardless of my stress levels or how active I am. I haven't noticed it getting better on days when I'm more relaxed.
Doctor [95%]: Given the persistence and specific nature of your symptoms, along with the normal imaging results and the lack of improvement with rest or changes in activity, it seems we might be dealing with a localized issue that's not necessarily tied to a broader systemic problem. DIAGNOSIS READY: Post-tympanoplasty syndrome with possible minor nerve irritation or localized post-surgical inflammation affecting the earlobe and surrounding tissue, leading to pain when pressure is applied or during certain movements like eating. Further evaluation by an ENT specialist is recommended for targeted treatment options, which may include pain management and possibly physical therapy to address the discomfort.

Patient [70%]: Yes, he does seem uncomfortable during feeds, often arching his back and crying more than usual. It's like he's trying to find a position that makes it easier for him to breathe.
Doctor [75%]: Given the symptoms you've described, it's important to check for any structural abnormalities that might be affecting his breathing and feeding. REQUEST TEST: Barium Swallow Study. This test can help us see how food moves through his esophagus and if there's any obstruction or abnormality causing these symptoms.
Measurement [75%]: RESULTS: Compression of the esophagus and trachea consistent with a vascular ring.
Doctor [80%]: Given the results of the Barium Swallow Study indicating a compression of the esophagus and trachea, it's crucial to understand the extent and specific nature of this vascular ring. REQUEST TEST: Echocardiogram. This will help us assess the heart and surrounding vessels for any abnormalities contributing to the symptoms.
Measurement [80%]: RESULTS: Confirmatory findings of a double aortic arch.
Doctor [85%]: Given the echocardiogram results confirming a double aortic arch, it's important to assess if there are any immediate concerns regarding his breathing or feeding that need to be addressed. Has your infant had any recent episodes of severe respiratory distress or inability to feed?
Patient [85%]: No, there haven't been any recent episodes of severe respiratory distress, but feeding has been consistently difficult. He still struggles and sometimes vomits after feeding.
Doctor [90%]: Given the consistent difficulty with feeding and the diagnosis of a double aortic arch, it's important to manage these symptoms effectively to ensure he remains healthy. Has your infant been seen by a pediatric cardiologist or a specialist in pediatric surgery to discuss potential treatment options?
Patient [90%]: No, we haven't seen a pediatric cardiologist or a specialist in pediatric surgery yet. We were waiting for the diagnosis to be confirmed before making any appointments.
Doctor [95%]: Given the confirmed diagnosis and the ongoing symptoms, it's crucial to consult with a pediatric cardiologist and possibly a pediatric surgeon as soon as possible. They can provide a detailed assessment and discuss potential treatment options, including surgical intervention to correct the double aortic arch, which could significantly improve his breathing and feeding difficulties. I recommend making an appointment with a specialist immediately. Would you like assistance in getting a referral to a pediatric cardiologist and surgeon?

Scenario 68 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: How long have you been experiencing wrist pain and difficulty in hand movement?
Patient [5%]: I've been experiencing the pain for about three months now. It's been particularly difficult when I try to hold my infant son or do anything that requires gripping with my right hand.
Doctor [10%]: Did the pain start suddenly or gradually increase over time?
Patient [10%]: It gradually increased over time, especially after I fell on my outstretched hand about six months ago.
Doctor [15%]: Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in the wrist area?
Patient [15%]: No, I haven't noticed any swelling, redness, or warmth in the area. It's mostly just the pain and difficulty in movement that's been bothering me.
Doctor [20%]: Have you taken any medication for the pain, and if so, did it provide any relief?
Patient [20%]: Yes, I've been taking ibuprofen as needed. It does provide some relief, but the pain usually comes back, especially when I'm holding something heavy or using my hand a lot.
Doctor [25%]: Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't experienced any numbness or tingling. It's mainly just the pain and difficulty with movement.
Doctor [30%]: Have you had any previous injuries to the same wrist or hand before the fall six months ago?
Patient [30%]: No, I haven't had any previous injuries to my wrist or hand before the fall six months ago. That was the first time I had hurt it.
Doctor [35%]: Have you noticed any clicking, popping, or grinding sounds when moving your wrist or during certain activities?
Patient [35%]: No, I haven't noticed any clicking, popping, or grinding sounds when moving my wrist or during any activities. It's just the pain and difficulty in movement that's been the issue.
Doctor [40%]: Have you tried any form of physical therapy or exercises specifically for your wrist since the pain began?
Patient [40%]: No, I haven't tried any physical therapy or specific exercises for my wrist yet. I've mostly been relying on the ibuprofen and using an ice pack to help with the pain.
Doctor [45%]: Have you noticed any decrease in grip strength or difficulty in performing tasks that require fine motor skills, such as buttoning a shirt or writing?
Patient [45%]: Yes, I've definitely noticed a decrease in grip strength, and it's been harder to do tasks that require fine motor skills, like buttoning my son's clothes or writing for a longer period. It's been quite frustrating.
Doctor [50%]: Have you experienced any changes in the shape or appearance of your wrist or hand since the injury occurred?
Patient [50%]: No, I haven't noticed any changes in the shape or appearance of my wrist or hand since the injury. It looks the same, just the pain and difficulty with certain movements.
Doctor [55%]: Given your symptoms and the history of your fall, it's important to assess the integrity of the structures within your wrist. REQUEST TEST: MRI of the right wrist. This will help us get a detailed view of the bones, cartilage, and ligaments to better understand the cause of your pain and difficulty in movement.
Measurement [55%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [60%]: Given the normal MRI results, it's good news that there's no structural damage visible. Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your symptoms over the past three months?
Patient [60%]: The pain hasn't really improved over the past three months; it's been pretty consistent. Holding my son or doing anything that requires gripping still aggravates it. The ice pack helps a bit, but the relief is temporary.
Doctor [65%]: Given the persistent nature of your pain despite normal MRI findings, it's possible we're dealing with a soft tissue condition that might not show up on an MRI. Have you noticed if rest improves your symptoms, or does the pain remain constant regardless of activity level?
Patient [65%]: Rest does seem to help a bit; the pain isn't as intense when I'm not using my hand or wrist too much. But it's hard to keep it rested with a baby at home. The pain is definitely more noticeable with activity.
Doctor [70%]: Given that rest seems to alleviate the pain somewhat, but it increases with activity, it's possible we're dealing with a repetitive strain injury or tendonitis. Have you engaged in any repetitive activities or work that could have contributed to this condition, especially after your fall?
Patient [70%]: Well, taking care of my infant son involves a lot of repetitive lifting and holding, which definitely seems to aggravate the pain. Other than that, I don't engage in any specific repetitive work activities, but my daily routine with my son is quite hands-on and repetitive in nature.
Doctor [75%]: Given your daily activities and the onset of symptoms following a fall, it sounds like we might be dealing with a case of tendonitis, possibly De Quervain's tenosynovitis, which is common in new parents from repetitive lifting of a child. Have you tried wearing a wrist splint or brace to see if it helps reduce your symptoms?
Patient [75%]: No, I haven't tried wearing a wrist splint or brace yet. Do you think that could help with the pain and difficulty in movement?
Doctor [80%]: Yes, wearing a wrist splint or brace could indeed help by immobilizing the wrist and allowing the tendons to rest, which might reduce your pain and improve your ability to move your hand. It's often recommended for conditions like De Quervain's tenosynovitis. How does your wrist feel in the mornings when you first wake up?
Patient [80%]: In the mornings, my wrist usually feels a bit stiff and sore, but it's not as painful as when I'm actively using it throughout the day. The pain and stiffness usually get worse as the day goes on, especially after I've been holding or lifting my son.
Doctor [85%]: Given the stiffness and soreness in the morning that worsens with activity, it's consistent with tendonitis symptoms. Have you noticed any specific movements that trigger more pain than others, such as turning your wrist or making a fist?
Patient [85%]: Yes, making a fist or turning my wrist to grasp something tightly definitely triggers more pain. It's those movements that seem to really aggravate it, especially if I'm holding onto something for a while.
Doctor [90%]: Given the specific movements that aggravate your pain, it aligns with the symptoms of De Quervain's tenosynovitis, which affects the tendons on the thumb side of your wrist. Before we proceed with a final diagnosis, have you tried any modifications in how you perform activities to reduce the strain on your wrist, such as using ergonomic tools or changing the way you lift your son?
Patient [90%]: I've tried to be more mindful of how I lift my son, trying to use my whole arm instead of just my wrist, but it's been challenging to consistently do so. I haven't used any ergonomic tools yet, but I'm open to trying anything that could help reduce the strain on my wrist.

Doctor [15%]: Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your arms or hands along with the pain?
Patient [15%]: Yes, I do. There's this tingling sensation in my hands, and sometimes it feels like they're not even there. It's quite unsettling.
Doctor [20%]: Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or hands, making it difficult to carry out tasks like opening jars or typing?
Patient [20%]: Absolutely, Doctor. Over the past few months, I've noticed it's become harder to grip things properly. Opening jars is a struggle, and my typing speed has definitely slowed down because my hands just don't seem to cooperate as they used to.
Doctor [25%]: Have you experienced any changes in your balance or coordination, or have you had any episodes of falling?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't had any issues with my balance or coordination, and I haven't fallen or anything like that. It's mainly just the pain, weakness, and the strange feelings in my hands.
Doctor [30%]: Have you had any previous injuries to your neck, back, or arms that might be contributing to your symptoms?
Patient [30%]: Yes, I was in a motor vehicle accident about 3 years ago. I had some whiplash and minor injuries, but nothing that seemed too serious at the time.
Doctor [35%]: Did you receive any treatment for your injuries after the motor vehicle accident, such as physical therapy or medication?
Patient [35%]: I did have some physical therapy sessions for a few months after the accident, and I was on pain medication for a short while. But once the immediate pain subsided, I stopped the therapy and medication.
Doctor [40%]: Have you noticed any changes in your neck or arm pain after coughing, sneezing, or straining?

Doctor [50%]: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to feel hot, cold, or pain in your arms or hands?
Patient [50%]: Yes, I've noticed that sometimes I can't really tell how hot or cold something is with my hands. And there are times when I don't feel pain as sharply as I used to, especially in my fingertips.
Doctor [55%]: Given your symptoms, it's important to assess the integrity of your nerve function. Can you describe if the numbness or tingling spreads to any specific fingers?
Patient [55%]: The numbness and tingling mostly affect my thumb, index, and middle fingers. Sometimes it feels like it spreads to my ring finger, but it's mainly those first three fingers that are affected.
Doctor [60%]: Given the areas affected, have you noticed any changes in your grip strength or difficulty in performing fine motor tasks, like buttoning a shirt or handling small objects?
Patient [60%]: Yes, definitely. Buttoning shirts has become quite a challenge, and handling small objects like coins or keys is frustrating. My grip just isn't what it used to be.
Doctor [65%]: Given your symptoms and the progression, it's important to check for any structural issues that might be affecting your nerves. REQUEST TEST: MRI of the cervical spine. This will help us see if there's any compression or damage in your neck area that could be causing your symptoms.

Doctor [55%]: Have you noticed any limitation in your knee's movement or difficulty in performing certain activities due to the swelling?
Patient [55%]: Yes, it's harder for me to crawl around and play like I usually do. I don't want to move it too much because it hurts.
Doctor [60%]: Have you or anyone in your family had any history of psoriasis or skin problems that might be related to joint issues?
Patient [60%]: No, we haven't had any issues with psoriasis or similar skin problems in our family that I'm aware of.
Doctor [65%]: Given the symptoms and family history you've described, it's important to check for any signs of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), which can present with swelling, warmth, and pain in the joints without a preceding injury. REQUEST TEST: Blood test for markers of inflammation (ESR, CRP) and autoantibodies (ANA, RF).
Measurement [65%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [70%]: Given the normal test results for inflammation markers and autoantibodies, it's good news that there's no immediate indication of an autoimmune condition. Have you noticed any changes in the size of the swelling in your knee over the past few days, whether it's getting bigger, staying the same, or reducing in size?

Patient [75%]: Yes, it's been hard for me to stand or walk on it. I mostly try to avoid putting weight on that leg because it hurts.
Doctor [80%]: Given the difficulty in walking and bearing weight on the affected leg, it's crucial to assess the structural integrity of your knee. REQUEST TEST: MRI of the right knee.
Measurement [80%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [85%]: Given the normal MRI results, which rule out major structural damage, we need to consider other causes for your symptoms. Have you or your family noticed any swelling in other joints besides your right knee, either now or in the past?
Patient [85%]: No, we haven't noticed swelling in any other joints, just this one in my right knee.
Doctor [90%]: Given the information we have so far, it's important to consider all possibilities. Have you experienced any episodes of intense pain that wake you up at night or any significant changes in your ability to perform daily activities since the swelling began?
Patient [90%]: No, I haven't been woken up by the pain, but it does make it harder for me to crawl and play like I normally would.
Doctor [95%]: Given the symptoms, family history, and test results, it seems we're dealing with a localized issue in the knee that's not related to a systemic autoimmune condition or major structural damage. Before making a final diagnosis, can you tell me if the swelling or pain in your knee improves with any specific treatments or actions, like applying ice or resting?
Patient [95%]: We haven't really tried anything specific like ice, but resting does seem to make it a bit less painful, at least for a while.

Doctor [60%]: Have you experienced any significant changes in your personal relationships or social behavior due to these symptoms?
Patient [60%]: Yes, my relationships have suffered. I've become more isolated because I find it hard to explain what I'm going through. My friends and family don't really understand why I'm so irritable and forgetful, and it's been causing a lot of tension.

Doctor [75%]: Have you experienced any significant stress or traumatic events in your life around the time these symptoms began or escalated?

Doctor [80%]: Have you sought any treatment or counseling for your stress and the symptoms you've been experiencing?
Patient [80%]: I've been seeing a therapist for my depression and stress, but I haven't started any specific treatment for these new symptoms yet. We've mostly been focusing on coping strategies for my mood and stress management.
Doctor [85%]: Have you noticed any improvement in your symptoms with the coping strategies and therapy sessions you've been attending?
Patient [85%]: Not really, the therapy helps a bit with managing my stress, but the voices and the restlessness haven't improved. The involuntary movements and swallowing issues are still there, too.
Doctor [90%]: Have you experienced any significant head injuries or infections that could explain these symptoms?
Patient [90%]: No, I haven't had any significant head injuries or infections. Everything started without any obvious reason like that.
Doctor [95%]: Have you noticed any patterns in the voices you hear, such as when they occur or what they might say?
Patient [95%]: The voices don't seem to follow any specific pattern, but they're more intense when I'm alone or stressed. They're usually quite critical, telling me I'm not doing things right or that I'm failing. It's really distressing.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Schizophrenia with possible co-occurring movement disorder, such as tardive dyskinesia, potentially related to past substance use or an emerging condition like Huntington's disease, despite the lack of family history.

Doctor [5%]: Hello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you tell me more about your fever? How high has it been, and have you noticed any patterns or specific times of day when it's worse?
Patient [5%]: Hi, Dr. Agent. My fever has been pretty high, I think it hit around 102°F at one point. It seems to be worse in the evening, but honestly, it's been pretty constant.
Doctor [10%]: Have you experienced any headaches, neck stiffness, or sensitivity to light along with your fever?
Patient [10%]: No, I haven't had any headaches, neck stiffness, or sensitivity to light. It's just been the fever and feeling really out of it, like I'm not fully aware of what's going on around me.
Doctor [15%]: Have you had any recent travel history or been in contact with anyone who was sick?
Patient [15%]: No, I haven't traveled recently or been around anyone who's sick that I know of.
Doctor [20%]: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to speak, move, or any confusion in addition to feeling out of it?
Patient [20%]: Yes, I've definitely felt more confused lately and it's been hard to keep track of things. I haven't noticed any changes in my ability to speak or move, though. Everything just feels more difficult to process.
Doctor [25%]: Have you had any vomiting, diarrhea, or any other gastrointestinal symptoms?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't had any vomiting, diarrhea, or other gastrointestinal symptoms. It's mainly just been the fever and confusion for me.
Doctor [30%]: Have you experienced any rash, difficulty breathing, or chest pain along with your symptoms?
Patient [30%]: No, I haven't had any rash, difficulty breathing, or chest pain. Just a lot of sweating and feeling really stiff all over.
Doctor [35%]: Have you had any seizures, or has anyone witnessed you having any unusual movements or behaviors?
Patient [35%]: No, I haven't had any seizures, and no one has mentioned seeing me have unusual movements or behaviors. But I've been feeling really rigid, like my whole body is tensed up more than usual.
Doctor [40%]: Given your symptoms of high fever, confusion, and feeling unusually rigid, it's important to check for any infections or neurological conditions that might be causing these symptoms. REQUEST TEST: Blood culture to check for any bacterial infections that could be causing your symptoms.
Measurement [40%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [45%]: Given the normal blood culture results, it's crucial to explore other causes for your symptoms. REQUEST TEST: Lumbar puncture to check for any signs of infection or inflammation in your central nervous system.
Measurement [45%]: RESULTS: CSF_Opening_Pressure: 22 cm H2O, CSF_White_Blood_Cells: 4 cells/mm3, CSF_Red_Blood_Cells: 0 cells/mm3, CSF_Glucose: 64 mg/dL, CSF_Protein: 48 mg/dL, Serum_Glucose: 96 mg/dL
Doctor [50%]: Given the results of your lumbar puncture, which show normal glucose levels and protein within the slightly elevated range, but no significant increase in white blood cells, it seems we can rule out bacterial meningitis. Have you experienced any muscle weakness or difficulty swallowing?
Patient [50%]: No, I haven't experienced any muscle weakness or difficulty swallowing. It's just this overwhelming rigidity and confusion that's been bothering me the most.
Doctor [55%]: Given your symptoms and the test results we have so far, it's important to consider other neurological conditions that might not show up directly in these tests. Have you noticed any changes in your temperature regulation, like feeling unusually hot or cold without any reason?
Patient [55%]: Yes, I've been feeling unusually hot, especially with the fever, but then I also get these bouts of profuse sweating even when it's not that warm. It's like my body can't decide if it's too hot or just right.
Doctor [60%]: Given your symptoms of fever, confusion, rigidity, and issues with temperature regulation, it's important to consider conditions that affect the brain's ability to control various bodily functions. REQUEST TEST: MRI of the brain to check for any abnormalities that might explain your symptoms.
Measurement [60%]: RESULTS: Brain_MRI: Findings: Unremarkable
Doctor [65%]: Given the unremarkable findings on your brain MRI, it seems we can rule out structural brain abnormalities as the cause of your symptoms. Have you had any exposure to medications or substances that could potentially cause these symptoms, such as antipsychotics or other neuroleptic drugs?
Patient [65%]: Yes, I've been taking haloperidol for my tics. I'm on a low dose, but I've been taking it for a while now.
Doctor [70%]: Given your use of haloperidol and the symptoms you're experiencing, it's possible you might be experiencing a reaction to the medication. Have you noticed any worsening of your symptoms after starting or increasing the dosage of haloperidol?
Patient [70%]: No, I haven't noticed any worsening right after starting or increasing the dosage of haloperidol. I've been on a stable dose for a while now. But these symptoms did start relatively recently.
Doctor [75%]: Given the stable dose of haloperidol and the onset of symptoms, it's important to consider if there might be an underlying condition exacerbated by the medication or a rare side effect occurring despite the stable dosage. Have you been on any other medications or supplements, either prescription or over-the-counter, that could interact with the haloperidol?
Patient [75%]: No, I haven't been on any other medications or supplements that could interact with the haloperidol. It's just been the haloperidol for my tics.
Doctor [80%]: Given your symptoms and the information you've provided, it seems we might be dealing with a case of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), which is a rare but serious reaction to antipsychotic drugs like haloperidol. Symptoms include high fever, confusion, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction, which matches what you're experiencing. DIAGNOSIS READY: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

Doctor [65%]: Do you have a bedtime routine that helps you feel relaxed before going to sleep, like reading a non-scary book or listening to calm music?
Patient [65%]: Yes, my mom usually reads me a story before bed, and we try not to pick anything scary. Sometimes we listen to calm music too, but I still end up feeling scared when it's time to actually go to sleep.
Doctor [70%]: Do you have a nightlight or some sort of light on in your room when you go to sleep, or do you prefer it to be completely dark?
Patient [70%]: I have a small nightlight by my bed. It helps a little, but I still get scared.
Doctor [75%]: Do you ever feel like you're falling or suddenly jerk awake from sleep before these frightening episodes happen?
Patient [75%]: No, I don't feel like I'm falling or jerk awake before it happens. It just suddenly starts when I'm already asleep.
Doctor [80%]: Do you ever feel sleepy or do you have moments during the day where you suddenly feel like you can't move or speak, even though you're awake?
Patient [80%]: No, I don't have moments like that during the day. I can move and talk just fine; it's only at night when I have those scary episodes that I feel really scared.
Doctor [85%]: Have you or your parents talked to anyone else about these episodes, like a teacher or a school counselor, and if so, what did they suggest?
Patient [85%]: No, we haven't talked to a teacher or a school counselor about it yet. My parents thought we should see a doctor first to understand what's happening and if we need to do anything special to help me sleep better.
Doctor [90%]: Have you noticed any patterns in your diet or activities on the days when these episodes occur, like consuming caffeine or engaging in particularly strenuous activities?
Patient [90%]: No, I don't think there's a pattern with what I eat or do. I don't have caffeine, and my activities are pretty much the same every day, like school and playing with my friends.

However, without any specific symptoms like fever, night sweats, changes in bowel habits, or identifiable lumps, and considering the duration of your symptoms, we need to look into conditions that might not present with very specific or localized symptoms initially. DIAGNOSIS READY: Considering the information provided, my initial diagnosis would lean towards a possible endocrine disorder such as an undiagnosed thyroid issue or a metabolic disorder. However, given the nonspecific nature of your symptoms, I strongly recommend further testing, including a comprehensive blood panel, thyroid function tests, and possibly imaging studies to explore this diagnosis further and rule out other potential causes.

Patient [85%]: Yes, I've definitely felt more thirsty than usual, and my mouth has been really dry, no matter how much water I try to sip.
Doctor [90%]: Given your symptoms of increased thirst and dry mouth, along with difficulty keeping fluids down, it's crucial to evaluate your hydration status further. REQUEST TEST: Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) to assess your electrolyte levels and kidney function.
Measurement [90%]: RESULTS: Serum_Electrolytes: Not specified
Doctor [95%]: Given the findings and your symptoms, it's clear we need to address this situation urgently. DIAGNOSIS READY: Esophageal perforation, likely secondary to the vomiting induced by alcohol consumption, leading to mediastinitis and dehydration. Immediate referral to a surgical team for evaluation and management is necessary.

Correct answer: Boerhaave syndrome

Scenario 94 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: How long have you had this wound on your right lower leg?
Patient [5%]: It's been there for about 6 months now.
Doctor [10%]: Has the wound changed in size or appearance since you first noticed it?
Patient [10%]: It hasn't really gotten bigger, but it hasn't healed at all. It looks about the same as when I first noticed it.
Doctor [15%]: Have you experienced any pain, redness, or swelling around the wound?
Patient [15%]: Yes, there's been some swelling around the wound, and it's pretty much constant. The leg itself has been swollen for years, but the area around the wound feels a bit more tender than the rest of the leg.
Doctor [20%]: Have you noticed any discharge or unusual smell coming from the wound?
Patient [20%]: Yes, there has been some discharge, but I wouldn't say it has a very strong smell. It's mostly clear, sometimes a bit yellowish.
Doctor [25%]: Have you had any fever or chills that you've noticed since the wound appeared?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't had any fever or chills.
Doctor [30%]: Do you have any underlying health conditions, such as diabetes or vascular disease, that we should be aware of?
Patient [30%]: No, I don't have diabetes or any diagnosed vascular disease. The only significant thing in my past medical history is a deep vein thrombosis in the same leg about 5 years ago.
Doctor [35%]: Have you been on any medication for the deep vein thrombosis, and are you currently taking any medications?
Patient [35%]: I was on blood thinners for a while after the DVT, but I'm not currently taking any medications for it or anything else.
Doctor [40%]: Have you tried any treatments or home remedies for the wound?
Patient [40%]: I've tried cleaning it regularly and applying some over-the-counter antibiotic ointment, but it doesn't seem to make much of a difference. I also tried keeping it covered with bandages to protect it.
Doctor [45%]: Have you had any previous surgeries or interventions on that leg, aside from the treatment for deep vein thrombosis?
Patient [45%]: No, I haven't had any surgeries or other interventions on my leg, just the treatment for the DVT.
Doctor [50%]: Have you noticed any changes in your ability to walk or perform daily activities due to the wound or the swelling in your leg?
Patient [50%]: Yes, actually. The swelling and the wound have made it more difficult to walk long distances. I get tired more easily and sometimes the pain limits my daily activities.
Doctor [55%]: Have you noticed any changes in the color or temperature of the skin around the wound or elsewhere on your leg?
Patient [55%]: Yes, the skin around the wound and on parts of my leg seems a bit darker than the rest of my skin. It also feels warmer to the touch compared to the other leg.
Doctor [60%]: Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation in your leg or around the wound?
Patient [60%]: No, I haven't experienced any numbness or tingling. The sensation around the wound and in my leg feels pretty normal, just the tenderness and warmth I mentioned.
Doctor [65%]: Have you noticed any varicose veins or changes in the veins of your leg since you've had the swelling and the wound?
Patient [65%]: Yes, I've noticed some varicose veins, especially around the swollen areas. They seem more prominent than before.
Doctor [70%]: Given the chronic nature of your wound, the swelling, and the presence of varicose veins, it's important to assess the blood flow in your leg. REQUEST TEST: Doppler Ultrasound of the Right Lower Leg
Measurement [70%]: RESULTS: Evidence of venous reflux and obstruction in superficial and deep venous systems of the right leg
Doctor [75%]: Given the results of the Doppler Ultrasound showing venous reflux and obstruction, have you noticed any skin changes such as thickening or discoloration in areas other than directly around the wound?
Patient [75%]: Yes, I've noticed that the skin on my lower leg, not just around the wound, has gotten a bit thicker and has a darker color compared to the rest of my skin. It's been like that for a while now.
Doctor [80%]: Given these symptoms and test results, it's crucial to understand the full scope of your daily activities and lifestyle. Can you describe your daily level of physical activity and if you've made any attempts to elevate your leg throughout the day?
Patient [80%]: My daily physical activity isn't very high. I work as an accountant, so most of my day is spent sitting at a desk. I've tried elevating my leg when I remember, especially in the evenings, but it's not consistent.
Doctor [85%]: Have you noticed any improvement in the swelling or the wound when you do manage to elevate your leg, even if it's not consistent?
Patient [85%]: I've noticed a slight improvement in the swelling when I elevate my leg, but it doesn't seem to make much difference to the wound itself. The swelling goes down a bit, but it comes back pretty quickly once I'm up and about again.
Doctor [90%]: Given the chronic nature of your wound, the lack of healing, and the symptoms you've described, it's important to consider all factors. Have you been exposed to any potential irritants or allergens that could be affecting the wound's ability to heal, such as certain types of dressings, soaps, or environmental factors?
Patient [90%]: I haven't really changed anything in terms of soaps or dressings that could irritate the wound. I've been using the same types of products for a while now, and I haven't noticed any reactions to them. As for environmental factors, nothing significant has changed in my living or working environment.
Doctor [95%]: Given everything we've discussed and the results of the tests, it seems we've covered a lot of ground regarding your symptoms and the condition of your wound. Before I make a final diagnosis, is there anything else about your health or lifestyle that you think might be relevant to mention?
Patient [95%]: Well, I think we've covered most of it. The only other thing I can think of is that my mother and brother had similar leg problems with swelling and wounds that were hard to heal. It seems like there might be a bit of a family history with these kinds of issues.

Scenario 95 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: Hello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you describe the movement disorder you're experiencing?
Patient [5%]: Hi, Dr. Agent. Yeah, I've been feeling really restless lately, like I just can't sit still. I keep fidgeting, pacing around, and I can't stop crossing and uncrossing my legs. It's been pretty constant.
Doctor [10%]: How long have you been experiencing these symptoms, and did they start suddenly or gradually?
Patient [10%]: They started a few weeks ago, pretty much out of nowhere. It's been like this almost every day since then.
Doctor [15%]: Have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior since these symptoms started?
Patient [15%]: Not really in terms of mood, but I've been feeling a bit more anxious because of this restlessness. It's hard to focus on my studies or relax.
Doctor [20%]: Have you started any new medications or changed your diet significantly before these symptoms began?
Patient [20%]: Actually, I started taking risperidone for my schizophrenia about two months ago. I haven't made any significant changes to my diet recently.
Doctor [25%]: Have you experienced any other side effects from the risperidone, such as changes in your sleep patterns or unusual sensations in your muscles?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't noticed any changes in my sleep or any weird sensations in my muscles. Just this constant need to move around.
Doctor [30%]: Have you had any episodes of feeling unusually high energy or happiness, or periods of feeling very down since starting the risperidone?
Patient [30%]: No, I haven't had any episodes like that. My mood has been pretty stable, just really bothered by this restlessness.
Doctor [35%]: Have you noticed if anything in particular makes your restlessness better or worse, such as physical activity or resting?
Patient [35%]: Physical activity seems to help a bit, like if I go for a walk, it eases for a while. But when I try to rest or sit down for my classes, it gets worse. It's like I just can't stay still.
Doctor [40%]: Have you experienced any involuntary movements, like twitching or jerking, in any part of your body besides the restlessness?
Patient [40%]: No, I haven't had any involuntary movements like twitching or jerking, just this overwhelming urge to move all the time.
Doctor [45%]: Have you noticed any difficulty in swallowing or speaking since these symptoms began?
Patient [45%]: No, I haven't had any trouble with swallowing or speaking. Everything seems normal there; it's just the constant need to move that's bothering me.
Doctor [50%]: Have you experienced any changes in your ability to think clearly or concentrate since these symptoms started?
Patient [50%]: Actually, now that you mention it, I've had a bit of trouble concentrating, especially since I'm always feeling the need to move. It's been harder to focus on my studies and pay attention during my classes.
Doctor [55%]: Have you had any previous episodes of movement disorders or restlessness before starting risperidone, or is this the first time?
Patient [55%]: This is the first time I've experienced anything like this. I've never had any issues with movement disorders or restlessness before starting risperidone.
Doctor [60%]: Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your schizophrenia symptoms since starting risperidone, aside from the restlessness?
Patient [60%]: Yes, I've noticed a significant improvement in my schizophrenia symptoms since starting risperidone. My delusions, hallucinations, and paranoid behaviors have really decreased, which has been a huge relief.
Doctor [65%]: It's good to hear that your schizophrenia symptoms have improved with risperidone. Given your symptoms of restlessness and the need to move, have you tried any treatments or interventions specifically for these movement issues?
Patient [65%]: No, I haven't tried any specific treatments for the movement issues yet. I wasn't sure what to do about it, so I was hoping to get some advice or recommendations from you today.
Doctor [70%]: Given your symptoms and the timing with starting risperidone, it sounds like you might be experiencing a side effect known as akathisia, which is a common side effect of antipsychotic medications. Have you taken any over-the-counter medications or supplements to try to alleviate these symptoms?
Patient [70%]: No, I haven't taken any over-the-counter medications or supplements for it. I wasn't sure what would be safe to take with my current medication, so I thought it best to consult with you first.
Doctor [75%]: Given your concerns and the symptoms you're experiencing, it's important we address this effectively. Have you noticed any patterns in the time of day when your restlessness is more pronounced, or is it fairly constant throughout the day?
Patient [75%]: It's fairly constant throughout the day, but I think it gets a bit worse in the evenings, especially when I'm trying to wind down or get ready for bed. That's when I really struggle to stay still.
Doctor [80%]: Given the impact this is having on your daily life and the timing with your medication, I'd like to explore some options to help manage this restlessness. Have you discussed these symptoms with the doctor who prescribed you risperidone, or have I been the first doctor you've consulted about this issue?
Patient [80%]: You're the first doctor I've consulted about this issue. I wasn't sure if it was related to the risperidone or something else, so I wanted to get your opinion on it.
Doctor [85%]: Given the symptoms you've described and their onset after starting risperidone, it's important we address this as it seems related to your medication. Have you experienced any relief at all at any point, or has the restlessness been consistently bothersome since it started?
Patient [85%]: It's been consistently bothersome since it started. There hasn't been any point where I've felt relief unless I'm moving around or walking, but as soon as I stop, the restlessness comes right back.
Doctor [90%]: Given the consistent nature of your symptoms and their significant impact on your daily life, it's crucial we consider adjusting your treatment plan. Before making any changes, I'd like to request a couple of tests to rule out any other potential causes. REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC) and REQUEST TEST: Thyroid Function Test. These tests will help ensure there's no underlying condition contributing to your symptoms.
Measurement [90%]: RESULTS: Complete Blood Count (CBC) shows White Blood Cells (WBC) at 5,000 /μL, Hemoglobin at 14 g/dL, and Platelets at 250,000 /μL. Thyroid Function Tests indicate Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) at 2.5 mIU/L and Free T4 at 1.1 ng/dL.
Doctor [95%]: Given the normal results of your Complete Blood Count and Thyroid Function Tests, it seems unlikely that an underlying condition is causing your symptoms. This further supports the possibility that what you're experiencing is indeed akathisia related to your risperidone treatment. Have you noticed any improvement in your restlessness after engaging in specific activities, aside from walking, that might help us tailor a management approach?
Patient [95%]: Well, besides walking, I've noticed that keeping myself busy with tasks helps a bit, like when I'm doing chores or working on a project for school. It doesn't completely stop the restlessness, but it does distract me from it for a while.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Akathisia related to risperidone use.

Correct answer: Akathisia

Doctor [15%]: Have you experienced any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite recently?
Patient [15%]: Yes, my sleep has been all over the place. I find it hard to sleep at night because that's when I feel most vulnerable. And I guess I haven't been eating much either; I just don't feel hungry.

Patient [20%]: Yeah, I've been feeling really down at times, especially after losing my job. And I get anxious a lot, especially when I think about how I'm being watched or controlled. It's like I'm on edge all the time.

Patient [55%]: No, I haven't sought any medical or psychiatric help before today. I was hoping it would get better on its own, but it hasn't.

REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC) to check for any signs of infection or anemia that could be affecting your energy levels and mood.
Measurement [60%]: RESULTS: Complete Blood Count (CBC) results are as follows: WBC (White Blood Cells) count is 7,500 /μL, which is within the normal range. Hemoglobin is 14 g/dL, also within the normal range, indicating no anemia. Platelets count is 230,000 /μL, which is normal.
Doctor [65%]: Given the normal CBC results, it's good to see there's no immediate concern for infection or anemia. Have you experienced any significant weight loss or gain in the last few months without trying?
Patient [65%]: I haven't really been keeping track, but my clothes do feel a bit looser. I guess I might have lost some weight without really trying to.
Doctor [70%]: Have you noticed any changes in your memory, like forgetting things more often than usual or trouble remembering important details?
Patient [70%]: Yes, I've noticed that I'm forgetting things more often. It's like my mind is so cluttered with worries that I can't hold onto details like I used to.
Doctor [75%]: Given your symptoms and the stress you've been under, it's important to consider your mental health in our assessment. REQUEST TEST: Thyroid Function Tests to rule out any thyroid issues that could be contributing to your mood and energy levels.

Scenario 101 Conversation:
Doctor [5%]: Hello, I'm Dr. Agent. Can you tell me more about your abdominal pain, such as when it started and if anything seems to trigger it?
Patient [5%]: Hi, Dr. Agent. The pain started suddenly about two hours ago while I was playing football. I can't think of anything specific that triggered it; it just came out of nowhere.

Patient [35%]: This is the first time I've ever experienced anything like this, Dr. Agent. I've never had similar pain in the past.
Doctor [40%]: Have you had any recent changes in your diet or eaten anything unusual that might have triggered this pain?
Patient [40%]: No, Dr. Agent, I haven't had any recent changes in my diet or eaten anything unusual. My eating habits have been pretty much the same.

Patient [45%]: No, Dr. Agent, I haven't noticed any loss of appetite or changes in my weight recently. Everything's been pretty normal with my eating.
Doctor [50%]: Have you felt any tenderness in the area where you're experiencing pain when you touch or press on it?
Patient [50%]: Yes, Dr. Agent, it does feel tender when I press on it. It's pretty sensitive to touch.
Doctor [55%]: Given the tenderness in that specific area, it's crucial to check for any signs of inflammation or infection internally. REQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC) to look for signs of infection or inflammation.
Measurement [55%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [60%]: Given the normal CBC results, we can rule out some causes of infection or systemic inflammation. Have you experienced any recent episodes of diarrhea or constipation that might be related to this pain?
Patient [60%]: No, Dr. Agent, I haven't had any episodes of diarrhea or constipation recently. Everything's been pretty regular in that regard.
Doctor [65%]: Given the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, let's focus on the area of pain. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in the area of pain on your lower right abdomen?
Patient [65%]: No, Dr. Agent, I haven't noticed any swelling or redness in the area. It just feels really tender and painful.
Doctor [70%]: Given your symptoms and the location of the pain, it's important to consider conditions specific to the lower right abdomen. REQUEST TEST: Ultrasound of the abdomen to check for any abnormalities in the appendix or surrounding areas.
Measurement [70%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [75%]: Given the normal ultrasound results, we can rule out appendicitis and other structural abnormalities in the abdomen. Have you experienced any recent urinary symptoms, such as burning during urination or an increased frequency to urinate, that we haven't discussed yet?
Patient [75%]: No, Dr. Agent, I haven't experienced any burning during urination or an increased frequency to urinate. Everything seems normal in that aspect.

Patient [80%]: No, Dr. Agent, I haven't been around anyone with similar symptoms, and I haven't traveled anywhere recently either. Everything's been pretty routine until this pain started.
Doctor [85%]: Given the sudden onset of your symptoms and the tests we've conducted so far, it's crucial to consider less common causes. Have you experienced any unusual stress or physical exertion lately, aside from playing football, that might not be typical for you?
Patient [85%]: No, Dr. Agent, playing football is pretty typical for me. I haven't experienced any unusual stress or physical exertion lately, just the usual activities and schoolwork.
Doctor [90%]: Given the information and test results we have, it seems we've ruled out many common causes of lower right abdominal pain. One last question: have you noticed any changes in your urine color, or has there been any blood in your urine that you've noticed?
Patient [90%]: No, Dr. Agent, I haven't noticed any changes in my urine color, and there hasn't been any blood in my urine either. Everything seems normal in that regard.
Doctor [95%]: Given all the information and normal test results, it appears we've ruled out many common and acute conditions. DIAGNOSIS READY: Musculoskeletal strain or injury from physical activity. It's possible that the sudden onset of sharp, localized pain without any gastrointestinal, urinary, or systemic infection symptoms could be due to a muscle strain or minor injury incurred during football, even without a direct impact or trauma. Rest, over-the-counter pain relief, and monitoring the pain for any changes would be advisable. If the pain worsens or new symptoms develop, please return for further evaluation.

Doctor [40%]: Have you experienced any clicking, popping, or grinding sensations in your knee when you move it?
Patient [40%]: No, I haven't felt any clicking, popping, or grinding. It just hurts and feels stiff, but no weird noises.

Doctor [20%]: Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
Patient [20%]: No, I've never smoked.
Doctor [25%]: Have you been exposed to any environmental or occupational irritants, such as chemicals, dust, or fumes, that could be contributing to your condition?
Patient [25%]: No, I haven't been exposed to any unusual chemicals, dust, or fumes in my environment or at work.
Doctor [30%]: Have you had any significant weight loss, night sweats, or fever in the past few months?
Patient [30%]: No, I haven't had any significant weight loss, night sweats, or fever recently.
Doctor [35%]: Have you been diagnosed with any allergies or asthma in the past?

Doctor [40%]: Have you noticed any improvement or worsening of your symptoms when you are in different environments, such as indoors versus outdoors?
Patient [40%]: No, I haven't noticed any difference in my symptoms whether I'm indoors or outdoors. The cough seems to persist regardless of where I am.
Doctor [45%]: Have you tried any treatments or medications for your cough, and if so, did anything help?
Patient [45%]: Yes, I've been prescribed antibiotics several times for what was thought to be recurrent bouts of bronchitis. They seem to help temporarily, but the cough always comes back after a while.
Doctor [50%]: Have you ever had a chest X-ray or any other imaging done to investigate your cough?
Patient [50%]: Yes, I've had a chest X-ray done in the past during one of the evaluations for bronchitis.
Doctor [55%]: Did the chest X-ray show any abnormalities or anything the doctors were concerned about?
Patient [55%]: The doctors mentioned some thickening in my airways but didn't seem overly concerned at the time. They suggested it might be due to the recurrent infections.
Doctor [60%]: Given the thickening in your airways noted on the chest X-ray, have you ever been evaluated for conditions that could cause such changes, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis?
Patient [60%]: No, I haven't been specifically evaluated for COPD or bronchiectasis. The focus has mostly been on treating the symptoms of bronchitis.
Doctor [65%]: Given your history of chronic cough and the thickening in your airways noted on the chest X-ray, it's important we investigate further. Have you experienced any episodes of breathlessness or difficulty breathing that you haven't mentioned yet?
Patient [65%]: No, I haven't experienced any episodes of breathlessness or difficulty breathing. My main issue has just been this persistent cough and the sputum production.
Doctor [70%]: Given the persistent nature of your cough and the history of thick sputum production, have you noticed any blood in your sputum at any time?
Patient [70%]: No, I haven't noticed any blood in my sputum at any time.
Doctor [75%]: Given your symptoms and history, it's crucial we conduct a more detailed examination of your lungs. REQUEST TEST: High-resolution CT scan of the chest. This will help us get a clearer picture of your airways and check for any signs of bronchiectasis or other abnormalities that might not have been fully evident on the chest X-ray.
Measurement [75%]: RESULTS: NORMAL READINGS
Doctor [80%]: Given the normal readings from the high-resolution CT scan of your chest, it's reassuring that we don't see signs of bronchiectasis or other structural abnormalities. Have you been evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which can sometimes cause a chronic cough?
Patient [80%]: No, I haven't been evaluated for GERD. Could that really be related to my cough?
Doctor [85%]: Yes, GERD can indeed be related to a chronic cough. The acid reflux can irritate your throat and airways, leading to coughing, especially noticeable in the morning. Have you noticed any symptoms of acid reflux, such as heartburn, regurgitation, or a sour taste in your mouth, especially after eating or at night?
Patient [85%]: Actually, now that you mention it, I have experienced heartburn and a sour taste in my mouth occasionally, especially after eating certain foods or lying down too soon after meals.
Doctor [90%]: Given these symptoms of heartburn and a sour taste in your mouth, especially after meals or when lying down, it's possible that acid reflux is contributing to your chronic cough. Have you tried any over-the-counter antacids or other medications for heartburn, and if so, did you notice any improvement in your cough after taking them?
Patient [90%]: I've tried over-the-counter antacids a few times, and they do seem to help with the heartburn, but I haven't really noticed if there's been much of an improvement in my cough after taking them.
Doctor [95%]: Given that the antacids help with your heartburn but you haven't noticed a significant improvement in your cough, it might be that the acid reflux is not fully controlled or that there's another contributing factor to your cough. Have you made any lifestyle changes to help manage your symptoms of acid reflux, such as avoiding certain foods, eating smaller meals, or not lying down immediately after eating?
Patient [95%]: Yes, I've tried to avoid spicy foods and I don't eat large meals late at night anymore. I also try to wait a few hours before lying down after eating. These changes have helped with the heartburn, but my cough still persists.
Doctor [100%]: DIAGNOSIS READY: Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) with a chronic cough as a secondary symptom. Given the persistence of your cough despite lifestyle modifications and the temporary relief of heartburn symptoms with antacids, it suggests that your cough may be related to acid reflux not fully controlled by over-the-counter medications. I recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation and possibly a trial of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to better manage your GERD and assess if there's an improvement in your cough.

Correct answer: Bronchiectasis
Scene 104, The diagnosis was INCORRECT (51%)
