This may involve a combination of rest, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications.\n\nIn the short-term, I recommend that you take a break from high-impact activities like volleyball for a few weeks to allow your knee to heal. We'll also need to work on strengthening the muscles around your knee to improve patellofemoral tracking and reduce the stress on your knee joint.\n\nIn terms of lifestyle modifications, I recommend that you continue to prioritize a balanced diet and regular exercise, but focus on low-impact activities like swimming or cycling. Avoiding activities that aggravate the pain, such as pivoting and twisting movements, is also essential.\n\nWe'll also need to work on proper knee mechanics and biomechanics to ensure that your knee is tracking properly. This may involve orthotics or shoe modifications to reduce stress on your knee joint.\n\nI'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
