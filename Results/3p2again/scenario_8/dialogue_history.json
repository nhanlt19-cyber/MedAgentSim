We've seen a solid, multinodular mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast, with a history of rapid growth over the past week.

The leaf-like structures and stromal cellular overgrowth seen on the biopsy are characteristic features of this type of tumor. The genetic testing also came back negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2, which reduces the likelihood of a hereditary component to the tumor.\n\nI'd like to reassure you that fibroadenolipomas are common, benign tumors that can cause discomfort or anxiety, but they are not cancerous. However, it's always a good idea to monitor them for any changes or growth over time.\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Benign Fibroadenolipoma"
