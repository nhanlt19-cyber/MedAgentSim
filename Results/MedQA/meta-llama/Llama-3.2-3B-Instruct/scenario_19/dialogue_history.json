The MRI test results showing a significant disc bulge and spinal cord compression, as well as the patient's history of frequent urination, especially at night, support this diagnosis.\n\nThe discussion highlighted the potential for compression of the cauda equina, which is a collection of nerve roots that can be compressed by a herniated disk. This compression can lead to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness in the legs, as well as frequent urination.\n\nWhile the other doctors suggested considering other possible diagnoses,"
