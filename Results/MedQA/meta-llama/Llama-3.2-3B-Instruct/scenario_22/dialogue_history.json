The combination of the lesion's location near the nipple and areola, its itchy, swollen, and red appearance, and the results of the ultrasound, mammogram, and fine-needle aspiration all support this diagnosis. While the patient's family history of breast cancer is a consideration, the benign nature of the test results and the patient's overall health and medical history suggest that the risk of malignancy is low. Therefore, the recommended course of action is to monitor the cyst and schedule follow-up appointments to ensure that it does not change in size."
