While Doctor 2 and Doctor 5 considered other possibilities, such as Dupuytren's contracture and gout, respectively, the overall consensus seems to be that ganglion cyst is the most probable diagnosis.\n\nHowever, Doctor 2 and Doctor 3 also raised concerns about the possibility of an inflammatory or infectious cause, which should not be ruled out entirely. Further testing, such as imaging studies or a biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.\n\nConsidering the majority vote and the discussion among the doctors, the final diagnosis is:\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Ganglion cyst."
