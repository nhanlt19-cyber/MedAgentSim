The patient's symptoms of pain, swelling, and instability in the knee, combined with the history of twisting and pivoting movements, support this diagnosis. The MRI results also show evidence of ligamentous damage, which further supports the diagnosis of an MCL sprain.\n\nWhile some doctors suggested the possibility of a patellofemoral pain syndrome or a meniscal tear, the majority of the doctors agree that the patient's symptoms and test results are most consistent with an MCL sprain. The EMG test results and arthroscopy may provide further confirmation of the diagnosis, but based on the information presented, an MCL sprain appears to be the most likely diagnosis.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the doctors did consider the possibility of"
