Based on your history of persistent bleeding post-wisdom tooth extraction, history of easy bruising, slight decrease in platelet count, and normal platelet count, I've reviewed the test results and considered the information we've gathered.\n\nYour bleeding episodes seem to be more consistent than just minor injuries, and the fact that they persist even after gentle pressure is applied suggests that there might be an underlying issue. The slight decrease in platelet count, although within the normal limits, combined with your history of easy bruising, points towards a disorder affecting platelet function or overall blood cell count.\n\nGiven the combination of symptoms and test results, I'm inclined to consider the possibility of a bleeding disorder, such as thrombocytopenia or von Willebrand disease. However, without further testing or more specific information, I would like to make a tentative diagnosis.\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Thrombocytopenia"
