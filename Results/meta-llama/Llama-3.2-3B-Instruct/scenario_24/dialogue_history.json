Based on the ultrasound results, the CA-125 blood test, and the pelvic exam results, I believe that you are likely suffering from ovarian cancer. The significant increase in abdominal girth, the large ovarian mass, and the elevated CA-125 levels are all indicative of ovarian cancer. Additionally, the symptoms of shortness of breath and changes in bowel movements or urination patterns can be related to the tumor's impact on your overall health.\n\nPlease know that this is a serious diagnosis, and we will need to discuss further treatment options with you. I will schedule an appointment with a specialist to discuss the best course of action for your care.\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Ovarian Cancer"
