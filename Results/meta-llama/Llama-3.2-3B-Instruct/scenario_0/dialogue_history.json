For example, if I'm doing something physically demanding, like climbing stairs or even just carrying groceries, my symptoms tend to get worse. But what's really interesting is that they tend to get better after a few hours of rest. I've found that if I take a break and sit down for a bit, my double vision seems to clear up, and I can usually get back to work without too much trouble.\""
