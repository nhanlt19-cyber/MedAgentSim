Your lipid profile shows slightly elevated triglycerides, which may be related to your elevated blood pressure. The echocardiogram revealed a murmur that suggests a possible heart valve issue.\n\nAfter reviewing your medical history, family history, and lifestyle, I believe the most likely cause of your systemic hypertension is a congenital heart defect, specifically a bicuspid aortic valve.
