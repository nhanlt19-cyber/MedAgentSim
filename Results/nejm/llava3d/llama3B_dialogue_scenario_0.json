It felt like my vision was being pulled in two different directions, and it was really disorienting."

Whenever I'm doing something that requires concentration, like graphic design or typing, the double vision seems to be more pronounced.

It's not that one arm is completely useless, but when I'm trying to brush my hair or carry groceries, it feels like my arms are just not getting the job done like they normally do. I can still feel the strength in my arms, but it's just not translating to the movements I'm trying to make."

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been pretty consistent, to be honest. The weakness has been there since the onset of double vision, and it's been getting progressively worse.

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I work as a graphic designer, so I'm on my feet for most of the day, and I do a lot of typing and computer work. I'd say I'm moderately active, but I try to take breaks and move around when I can. When the double vision hits, it's like my brain is trying to split the image in two, but it's not a complete split \u2013 there's usually a bit of overlap. Sometimes, I'll see a blurry outline of the image, and other times it's more like a wavy, distorted picture."
