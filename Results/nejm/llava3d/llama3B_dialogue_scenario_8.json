As we previously discussed, we'll schedule regular check-ups every 12 months to monitor the lesion and ensure it doesn't change or grow in size. In the meantime, I recommend that you perform self-examinations on a monthly basis to become more familiar with your breast tissue and notice any changes or abnormalities. I also want to remind you to be aware of any changes in your breast, such as tenderness, swelling, or discharge. If you notice any unusual changes, please don't hesitate to contact me or schedule an appointment. In addition to self-examinations, I recommend that you keep a log of any changes you notice in your breast tissue. This will help us track any changes over time and make adjustments to your follow-up schedule as needed. Now, I'd like to discuss the possibility of a mammogram every 6-12 months to monitor the lesion. This will help us catch any potential changes or abnormalities early on, and ensure that the lesion remains benign.

Are there any specific techniques or methods I should use to check my breasts? Doctor: Excellent, I'm glad you're taking an active role in your own care. For self-examinations, I recommend that you use the breast self-examination (BSE) technique, which involves feeling your breasts for any lumps or abnormalities. You can do this by lying down and placing your fingers on the top of each breast, then moving down to the bottom. You can also use your other hand to feel the underside of each breast. It's a good idea to start when your breasts are empty, so you can get a more accurate reading. Patient: Okay, I think I understand. I'll make sure to do that regularly. Can I ask, what kind of follow-up schedule can I expect? Will I need to come in every 6 months, or can we space it out further? Doctor: We can definitely space out the follow"
