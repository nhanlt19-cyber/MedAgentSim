However, it's always good to be aware of any potential family history. Now, I'd like to explain a bit more about Hirschsprung disease and what it means for you. Hirschsprung disease is a condition where the nerves that control the muscles in the intestines don't develop properly, leading to a blockage in the intestines. This can cause severe constipation, abdominal distension, and feeding difficulties, as we've seen in your case. Given the results of the tests and your symptoms, I believe that Hirschsprung disease is the underlying condition that we're dealing with. We'll need to discuss the next steps and treatment options with your parents, but for now, I think we have a good understanding of what's going on.\""

Now, let's talk about the treatment options. Since you have Hirschsprung disease, we'll need to perform surgery to remove the affected portion of the intestine and create a new opening for waste to pass through. This will help relieve the blockage and allow you to pass stool normally. We'll also need to monitor your progress closely to make sure everything is healing properly.\" \"Okay, I think I understand. But what about the feeding difficulties? Will I still be able to eat and drink normally?\" \"We'll need to work with a team of specialists to help you with your feeding and nutrition. We'll probably need to insert a feeding tube to help you get the nutrients you need, and we'll also need to monitor your progress closely to make sure you're gaining weight and developing normally. But don't worry, we'll do everything we can to help you thrive.\""

You'll still be able to wear diapers, but you'll also have a special bag that will collect your waste and help you stay clean.
