RESULTS: * Electrocardiogram (ECG): Normal, no abnormalities detected. * Family history: No history of autoimmune disorders or myasthenia gravis.

RESULTS: * Blood test for myasthenia gravis antibodies: Present (elevated) Doctor: Thank you for your response. Based on the test results and your symptoms, it seems like we have a clear diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. I'd like to discuss treatment options with you. We can start with medications that can help manage your symptoms, such as pyridostigmine or prednisone. Additionally, we can consider immunotherapy options like plasmapheresis or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to target the autoimmune response. Do you have any questions or concerns about the treatment options?

RESULTS: MRI of the brain and spine: * Findings: + Bilateral mild pontine atrophy. + Mild cerebellar atrophy. + Mild peripheral neuropathy. + No evidence of thymoma or other masses. Impression: * Mild neurodegenerative changes, likely related to the patient's symptoms. * Recommend further evaluation with a neurologist for management and treatment. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.

RESULTS: MRI Brain: Findings: * Mild bilateral ptosis (drooping of the eyelids) * Mild weakness of the extraocular muscles * No evidence of thymoma or other masses * No signs of inflammation or infection Impression: Mild bilateral ptosis and weakness of the extraocular muscles, likely due to a neurological disorder. Further evaluation with an EMG and nerve conduction studies is recommended to determine the underlying cause.

Ptosis: The ptosis worsens with sustained upward gaze, and it is more noticeable when you are trying to look up at things like the ceiling or at people's faces. It is not constant, but rather seems to be triggered by activities that require you to look up or focus intensely for an extended period. Activities such as reading, looking at your computer screen for a long time, or trying to look at people's faces or high ceilings tend to exacerbate the ptosis.
