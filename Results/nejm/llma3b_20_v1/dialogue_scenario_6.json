Doctor: Okay, I think we've covered a lot of ground. I'd like to summarize what we've discussed so far. You've experienced an episode of loss of consciousness, which was sudden and brief. You've also reported feeling dizzy and lightheaded when standing still for an extended period, and you get a bit dizzy when standing on an uneven surface. Additionally, you've mentioned feeling a constant pressure sensation in your head, which you've described as a gentle squeezing or soft pressure. Is that correct? Patient: Yes, that's correct."

Doctor: I'd like to ask a few more questions to help narrow down the possible causes of your episode of loss of consciousness. Can you tell me more about your symptoms now? Are you experiencing any pain, numbness, or weakness in any part of your body? Patient: I'm feeling a bit dizzy and lightheaded, but nothing too severe. I don't have any pain or numbness in my body right now, but I'm still feeling a bit off and unsure of what's going on. Doctor: Okay, I think we're getting close to understanding what might be going on. I'd like to ask, have you experienced any recent changes in your environment that might be contributing to this episode of loss of consciousness? Patient: I think I mentioned that"
