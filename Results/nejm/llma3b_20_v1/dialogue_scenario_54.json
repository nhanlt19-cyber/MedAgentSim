After reviewing all of the information you've shared with me, I believe that you are experiencing symptoms of Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), which is a neurological disorder that affects how the brain processes sensory information. Your experiences of hearing voices and sensations from animals, feeling overwhelmed by sensory input, and feeling disconnected from the world around you are all consistent with SPD. I also notice that you've been taking Peruvian herbs, which may be contributing to your symptoms. I'm going to recommend that you stop taking them and see if that makes a difference. Additionally, I'm concerned that you may be experiencing some symptoms of Anxiety Disorder, such as excessive worry and fear. I'm going to recommend that you see a therapist to work through these symptoms. Finally, I want to note that your symptoms are not necessarily related to your brain or your mental health, but rather to your nervous system and how it processes sensory information. I'm going to recommend that you see a neurologist to rule out any underlying neurological conditions. I hope this diagnosis is helpful in explaining what's been going on with you."

We'll discuss alternative ways to manage your symptoms, but for now, let's focus on getting to the bottom of what's really going on with your brain and nervous system.\" \"That makes sense, I guess.
