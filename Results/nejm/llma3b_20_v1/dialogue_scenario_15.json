    "text": "I think I've covered all the necessary questions and tests. Based on the patient's symptoms, examination, and test results, I'm going to make a diagnosis. After reviewing the MRI results, FNAC results, and the patient's medical history, I believe the patient is likely suffering from a benign cystic lesion, specifically a lymphatic malformation or a benign thyroid nodule. The swelling is soft to the touch, and the MRI results show a well-circumscribed and cystic lesion. Given the patient's symptoms, such as the sensation of heaviness on the left side, tenderness in the lymph nodes, and irregular bowel movements, it's possible that the lesion is causing compression or irritation to surrounding tissues. I'm going to rule out any malignant lesions, as the FNAC results and MRI results do not suggest any cancerous cells or invasion into surrounding tissues. I'm also going to rule out any thyroid-related issues, as the thyroid function tests (TFTs) are normal. Based on the patient's symptoms and examination, I'm going to make a diagnosis of a benign lymphatic malformation or a benign thyroid nodule, likely causing compression or irritation to surrounding tissues. I recommend further monitoring and follow-up appointments to ensure the lesion does not grow"
