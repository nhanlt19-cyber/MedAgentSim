    "text": "DIAGNOSIS READY: Adrenal Insufficiency with Hypervigilance and Autonomic Dysregulation Doctor: Based on our conversation, I believe that you are suffering from adrenal insufficiency, which is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and other hormones. This can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and anxiety. Additionally, your hypervigilance and autonomic dysregulation, as evidenced by your elevated heart rate and blood pressure, suggest that you may be experiencing a condition known as \"fight or flight\" syndrome. I also want to note that your elevated cortisol levels and low potassium levels suggest that your adrenal glands may not be producing enough aldosterone, a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, fatigue, and dizziness. Given your symptoms and test results, I am diagnosing you with adrenal insufficiency with hypervigilance and autonomic dysregulation. This condition requires medical attention and treatment to manage your symptoms and prevent further complications. I would like to discuss treatment options with you, including hormone replacement therapy, lifestyle changes, and stress management techniques. I also want to refer you to a specialist, such as an endocrin"
