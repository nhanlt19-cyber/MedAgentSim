It's also about prioritizing your own emotional well-being and taking care of yourself. To address your concerns, I'd like to suggest a few strategies. First, consider having an open and honest conversation with your mother about your feelings and needs. It's possible that she's not aware of the impact her behavior is having on you, and talking about it can help to clear the air and establish a better understanding. Second, think about setting specific boundaries that are clear, direct, and respectful. For example, you might say, 'Mom, I appreciate your concern, but I'd prefer it if you didn't offer unsolicited advice. I'll make my own decisions, and I'd appreciate it if you could support me in that.' Third, be prepared for a range of reactions, including upset, disappointment, or even guilt trips.

(pause) Yes, I have a therapist in mind who I think would be a great fit for you. Her name is Dr. Smith, and she has extensive experience working with patients with anxiety and stress-related disorders. She's also a licensed therapist with a strong background in both CBT and psychodynamic therapy. As for self-care practices, I recommend starting with some simple techniques such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, and mindfulness meditation.

This can help you identify patterns and triggers, and also provide you with a sense of control and empowerment. Additionally, I suggest engaging in some physical activities that you enjoy, such as walking, yoga, or swimming. Exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood-boosters. Lastly, I recommend setting aside time each day for self-care, whether it's reading a book, taking a warm bath, or simply spending time in"
