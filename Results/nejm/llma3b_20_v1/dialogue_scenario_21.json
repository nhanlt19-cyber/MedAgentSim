The Blood Test: Complete Blood Count showed that your white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which could indicate an infection or inflammation. The Blood Test: Rheumatoid Factor test came back negative, which suggests that you don't have rheumatoid arthritis. The Blood Test: ESR test showed that your erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated, which indicates inflammation in the body.

As for lifestyle changes, I'd like to recommend that you start doing some gentle exercises to help maintain the strength and flexibility of your knee joint. We can also discuss some changes to your diet that may help reduce inflammation and promote healing.
