It's thought to stimulate healing and reduce inflammation by promoting the growth of new tissue.

The frequency of treatment will depend on your individual needs, but we can start with a series of sessions once a week and adjust as needed. Some patients find that regular acupuncture sessions can help reduce pain and inflammation, while others may require more frequent treatment.\" \"Okay, that makes sense.

    "text": "\"Based on the examination and test results, I believe that you are suffering from a condition known as De Quervain's tenosynovitis, which is a common condition that affects the tendons on the thumb side of your wrist. The inflammation and pain you're experiencing in your right ring finger are likely due to the repetitive strain and stress on the tendon and surrounding tissues. I also believe that the football incident may have exacerbated the condition, causing further inflammation and pain in the affected area. Considering your symptoms and the findings, I am going to prescribe a course of anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the inflammation and pain in your finger. I will also recommend physical therapy to help improve your range of motion, strength, and flexibility in your finger. In addition, I will schedule a follow-up appointment with the sports medicine specialist to discuss your football activities and how we can modify them to reduce the stress on your finger. I want to assure you that with proper treatment and care, you should be able to manage your symptoms and get back to your normal activities, including playing football. DIAGNOSIS READY: De Quervain's Tenosynovitis\""
