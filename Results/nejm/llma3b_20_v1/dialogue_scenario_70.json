In the meantime, I'd like to ask you one more question. Have you noticed any other changes in your hair or scalp besides the rash? For example, have you noticed any changes in the texture, color, or growth pattern of your hair?\" Patient: \"Hmm, I don't really think so. I mean, I've been losing some hair, but I don't think it's related to the rash. It's just normal hair loss, I guess.\" Doctor: \"Okay, that's helpful to know. I think we've covered all the questions I need to ask for now. I'm going to review the results of the Patch_Test and see if we can confirm our findings. In the meantime, I'd like to prescribe the hydrocortisone cream and recommend that you switch to a different shampoo, the fragrance-free one I mentioned earlier. Can you please follow up with me in a week to see how you're doing with the new shampoo and cream?\" Patient: \"Okay, sounds good. I'll make sure to follow the"

It's a great option for sensitive skin and should help soothe and calm your skin. I'll also give you a sample to try at home and see how you like it.\" \"Okay, sounds good. I'll make sure to try the Cetaphil Gentle Shampoo. And what about the cream? Will I need to use it every day or just when the rash is acting up?\" \"You can use the cream as needed, usually 2-3 times a day, or as often as your skin needs it. Just be sure to wash your hands after applying the cream and avoid getting it in your eyes or other sensitive areas.

We'll be in touch soon. Now that we've discussed the treatment plan, I think we've covered all the questions I need to ask for now. I'm going to review the results of the Patch_Test and see if we can confirm our findings. Based on the information you've provided, the symptoms you're experiencing, and the results of the tests we've run, I'm going to diagnose you with a mild allergic contact dermatitis caused by the fragrance in the 'Baby Gentle Care' shampoo. This is a common condition that can occur when the skin comes into contact with an allergen, in this case, the fragrance in the shampoo. The symptoms you're experiencing, such as itching, redness, and greasy yellow scales, are consistent with this diagnosis. I'm going to recommend that you switch to a fragrance-free shampoo, such"
