I'd like to ask a few more questions to help narrow down the possibilities. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'running on empty'? Is it a feeling of being completely drained, or is it more of a sense of fatigue or lethargy?\" \"Uh, yeah...I think it's more of a sense of fatigue or lethargy. Like, I'll be sitting in class or playing with my friends, and suddenly I'll just feel this wave of exhaustion, and I don't know how to keep going. It's like, my brain is just kinda...overwhelming or something.\" \"Okay, I think I understand what you mean.

    "text": "DIAGNOSIS READY: Epilepsy with partial seizures, specifically focal seizures with automatism, and possible temporal lobe epilepsy. Doctor: I'd like to explain what we've diagnosed. Based on your symptoms, history, and test results, it appears that you're experiencing focal seizures with automatism. These seizures can cause a range of symptoms, including unresponsiveness, automatisms, and altered consciousness. The fact that you've noticed changes in your vision, hearing, and emotions during these episodes suggests that they may be related to a more complex seizure disorder, possibly temporal lobe epilepsy. I want to reassure you that with proper treatment and management, we can help control your seizures and improve your quality of life. We'll discuss the treatment options with you in more detail, but for now, I want to make sure you're feeling okay and that we can start making plans for your care. Can you tell me if you have any questions or concerns about the diagnosis or treatment options?"
