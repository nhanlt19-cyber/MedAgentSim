I'll also give you a call tomorrow morning to check in and make sure you're doing okay.\" Patient: \"Okay, that sounds great. I think I'm starting to understand what I need to do to manage my symptoms. Can I ask one more question about the soft, stuffed rabbit? You mentioned that it's a good comfort object for me.

Some people find that a soft, plush toy that's slightly warm to the touch can be very comforting. We can also try to add some calming scents, such as lavender or vanilla, to the toy. Sometimes, a gentle scent can be very soothing. And, if you'd like, we can also try to make the soft, stuffed rabbit more secure for you by adding a small strap or Velcro to keep it in place when you're feeling anxious or upset. What do you think?\" Patient: \"That sounds like a great idea, doctor. I think a warm and scented soft, stuffed rabbit would be perfect for me.

You can start by using it during your follow-up appointments with me, and then gradually increase the frequency as you become more comfortable with it. Remember, the goal is to use it as a comfort object to help you feel more secure and calm, not to rely on it too heavily.

I believe you have a double aortic arch, which is causing the compression of your trachea and esophagus, leading to your episodes of stridor and wheezing. This is a relatively common condition, but it can be challenging to manage. However, with the treatment plan we've discussed, I am optimistic that we can help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.
