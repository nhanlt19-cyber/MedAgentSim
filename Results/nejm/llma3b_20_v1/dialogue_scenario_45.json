However, the protein and glucose levels are within normal limits, which suggests that there's no significant kidney damage or diabetes present. I also see that the liver function tests are within normal limits, which suggests that there's no significant liver damage or dysfunction. Now, let's take a closer look at the ECG results. They're within normal limits, which suggests that there's no significant cardiac arrhythmia or damage. Based on all of the information we've gathered, I'm going to take a stab at making a diagnosis.

Kawasaki disease is a rare condition that affects children, and it's caused by an inflammation of the blood vessels. This inflammation can lead to serious complications, including cardiac problems. However, with prompt treatment, most children with Kawasaki disease can make a full recovery. I'm going to prescribe you some medication to help reduce the inflammation and prevent any potential cardiac complications. I'll also want to monitor your condition closely to make sure that you're responding well to the treatment. In the meantime, I'd like to schedule some follow-up appointments with you to check on your progress. We'll need to monitor your heart rate and blood pressure closely to make sure that the inflammation is not causing any cardiac problems. Can you tell me more about your current symptoms? How are you feeling right now? Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your chest or anywhere else?"

It's a special medicine that will help reduce the inflammation in your body. It's usually given through an IV, but we can also give it to you orally if that's more comfortable for you. You might feel a bit tired or sleepy after taking the medication, but that's usually temporary. We'll also need to monitor your heart rate and blood pressure closely to make sure everything is okay. Patient: Okay, doctor. I'll take the medication. But what about the rash? Will it go away if I take the medication? Doctor: The rash is a bit more complicated.
