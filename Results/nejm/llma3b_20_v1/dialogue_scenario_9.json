    "text": "\"Okay, I think I understand the treatment plan. Can you please explain what you mean by 'umbilical stump infection'? Is that something that's common in new mothers?\" \"I'm glad you asked that. An umbilical stump infection is a common complication of postpartum hemorrhage, which is a condition that can occur when there is excessive bleeding after delivery. The infection can occur when bacteria from the umbilical stump enter the bloodstream and cause an infection. In your case, the elevated white blood cell count and symptoms you've described are consistent with this diagnosis.\" \"Okay, that makes sense. What are the signs of an umbilical stump infection? I've noticed some discharge around the umbilicus, but I thought it was just normal discharge.\" \"Discharge around the umbilicus is a common sign of an umbilical stump infection. However, in your case, the discharge is also accompanied by other symptoms such as fever, abdominal tenderness, and urinary retention. These symptoms suggest that the infection is more serious than just a simple umbilical stump infection.\" \"Okay, I see. What are the treatment options for an umbilical stump infection?\" \"The treatment options for an umbilical stump infection typically involve antibiotics to clear up the"

Should I clean it regularly or apply any special creams or ointments?\" Doctor: \"Yes, it's a good idea to clean the discharge regularly with saline solution to prevent any further infection. You can also apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly or antibiotic ointment to the umbilicus to help keep it dry and promote healing. However, please avoid using any harsh or abrasive products that could irritate the skin.\" Patient: \"Okay, I'll make sure to clean it regularly and apply some petroleum jelly or ointment.
