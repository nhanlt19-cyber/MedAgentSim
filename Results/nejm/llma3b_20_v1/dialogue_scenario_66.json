    "text": "It sounds like you're having trouble keeping up with your siblings and you're also experiencing some changes in your appetite. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're playing with your siblings? Do you feel like you're getting frustrated or feeling left behind, or is it more of a general feeling of being tired or sluggish? Also, I'd like to ask, have you noticed any changes in your stool or bowel movements? Are you having trouble passing stools or do you have any other changes in your digestive system? And, I'd like to request a test to further assess your cardiac output. Can you please hold out your arm and I'll take a look at your pulse and blood pressure again? Also, I'd like to ask, have you noticed any changes in your urine output or color? Are you urinating regularly, and is your urine pale yellow or darker? I'd like to review the test results we've done so far. We've looked at your oxygen levels, heart sounds, liver size, and cardiac output, and everything seems to be within normal limits. However, I'd like to request another test to further assess your cardiac output. Can you please hold out your arm and I'll take a look at your pulse and blood pressure again?"

It sounds like you're experiencing some frustration and fatigue when playing with your siblings. Can you tell me more about what happens when you're trying to engage in activities that require a lot of energy, such as playing with toys or running around? Do you feel like you're getting tired easily, or is it more of a feeling of being mentally fatigued? Me: I think it's a bit of both, to be honest. When I'm playing with toys, I can usually focus for a bit, but then my brain just... feels foggy, like it's hard to think clearly. And when I'm running around, I get really tired really quickly.
