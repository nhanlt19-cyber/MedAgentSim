And, I'd like to discuss the results of the Cholecystogram test we're going to run.

The treatment options for primary biliary cholangitis are aimed at managing your symptoms, slowing the progression of liver damage, and preventing complications. We'll be prescribing medications to reduce inflammation and slow the progression of liver damage. These may include ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which is a bile acid that helps to reduce inflammation and slow the progression of liver damage. We may also prescribe corticosteroids or immunosuppressants to reduce inflammation and prevent the immune system from attacking the bile ducts. In addition to medication, we'll also need to monitor your liver function tests and vitamin B12 levels regularly to ensure that your condition is not progressing. We'll also work with you to make any necessary lifestyle changes to help reduce inflammation and slow the progression of liver damage. It's also important to note that we'll need to follow up with regular blood tests and imaging studies to monitor your liver and gallbladder health. This may include regular liver function tests, ultrasound exams, and potentially even a liver biopsy in the future if we need to assess the extent of liver damage.
