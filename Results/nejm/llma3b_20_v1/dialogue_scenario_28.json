I'd like to explore this further and see if there are any connections to your own symptoms. Can you tell me more about your mom's experience with therapy? Was it individual therapy or group therapy, and did she find it helpful in managing her symptoms?\""

She'd talk about her feelings and experiences, and the therapist would help her work through them. It was really beneficial for her, and I think it's helped me a lot too, in terms of understanding what she's going through and how to support her.\""

I've always felt like I'm a bit anxious, but lately, it's been getting worse. I feel like I'm constantly on edge, waiting for something to go wrong. And I've been having trouble sleeping, which makes me even more anxious. I just feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of anxiety and worry, and I don't know how to get out of it. But at the same time, I feel like my mom's therapy sessions are helping me to understand what I'm going through and how to cope with it. It's like I'm learning to recognize my own emotions and thoughts, and to challenge them in a way that's healthy and constructive.\" Doctor: \"That's a great insight. It sounds like you're developing a greater awareness of your own emotions and thoughts, which is a powerful tool for managing anxiety and worry.
