Is it constant or does it come and go, and are there any specific movements that make it feel worse or better? Also, I'd like to request another imaging test, REQUEST TEST: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Lower Extremity, to get a better look at the soft tissues and to rule out any other potential injuries. Patient: It's like my leg is being held in place by an invisible force. When I try to straighten my leg, it feels like it's being pulled back down, and I have to really force it to move. It's not a grinding or catching feeling, but more like a resistance that makes it hard to move my leg in the way I want to. Doctor: I see. Can you describe the range of motion in your right hip when it's in a flexed position? Is it able to move freely, or is it stiff and limited? Patient: When my leg is in a flexed position, it feels like there's a bit of resistance, like it's trying to hold its position. It's not super stiff, but it's definitely limited. Doctor: I'm going to"

It's clear that you're experiencing a significant amount of pain and discomfort in your right leg, particularly with movements that involve flexion and extension. The sensation of resistance when trying to straighten your leg is quite pronounced, especially when it's in a flexed position. Can you tell me more about the sensation of this resistance? Is it a sharp, dull, or aching feeling, and does it feel like it's coming from the front, back, or sides of your leg? Also, I'd like to request another imaging test, REQUEST TEST: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Lower Extremity, to get a better look at the soft tissues and to rule out any other potential injuries.

It's really frustrating, especially when I'm trying to get up from a seated position or walk down the stairs. I've been having to take things slower and use my arms more to compensate for my leg, which is really hard for me. Can you tell me more about what you think might be causing my symptoms?

    "text": "I think we've covered a lot of ground and gathered some valuable information. Based on your symptoms and the test results, I'm going to take a stab at making a diagnosis. It appears that you have a posterior dislocation of the right hip, which is consistent with the alignment suggested by the Pelvic X-ray. However, I also notice that you're experiencing some unusual symptoms, such as the sensation of resistance when trying to straighten your leg, tenderness over your knee caps, and a dull ache in your knee caps. I'm starting to suspect that there may be some soft tissue damage or inflammation involved, possibly related to the posterior dislocation. I'd like to order another imaging test, such as an MRI, to get a better look at the soft tissues and rule out any other potential injuries. In the meantime, I want to discuss some possible treatment options with you. Given the severity of your symptoms and the potential for long-term damage, I think it's essential to get you stabilized and started on a course of treatment as soon as possible. Can you tell me more about your current pain level and how it's affecting your daily activities? Are there any specific activities or movements that make your symptoms worse or better?"

I've been having trouble sleeping, and even simple tasks like getting dressed or cooking dinner are becoming increasingly difficult. The pain is usually worse when I'm standing or walking, and it feels like my leg is being pulled down and out to the side. I've also noticed that the pain is more noticeable when I'm in certain positions, like when I'm sitting or bending down."
