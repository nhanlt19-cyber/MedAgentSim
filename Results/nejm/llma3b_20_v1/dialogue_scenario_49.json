According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Lyme disease affects approximately 300,000 people in the United States each year. While it's true that you may not have heard of it before, it's a condition that's becoming increasingly recognized and treated. As for the treatment plan, antibiotics are usually the first line of treatment for Lyme disease. The type of antibiotic used will depend on the severity of the infection and the stage of the disease. In your case, we'll likely start with a course of doxycycline or amoxicillin. We'll also need to monitor your response to treatment and adjust the plan as needed. It's worth noting that Lyme disease can be treated effectively with antibiotics, and most people make a full recovery within a few weeks to a few months. However, in some cases, the disease can progress to more severe complications, such as meningitis or encephalitis. But that's rare, and we'll be closely monitoring your progress to ensure that you receive the best possible care.

During treatment, you'll likely be taking doxycycline or amoxicillin for a period of 2-4 weeks, depending on the severity of the infection and your response to treatment. You may also need to take some additional medications to help manage any side effects or symptoms. We'll discuss those with you in more detail when you start treatment. As for symptoms, you may experience some side effects from the antibiotics, such as nausea, diarrhea, or headaches. However, these are usually mild and temporary. You may also experience some fatigue or weakness, especially during the first few days of treatment. But this should subside as your body starts to respond to the medication. In terms of feeling better, it's hard to predict exactly when you'll start to feel improved. Some people experience significant improvement within a few days, while others may take longer. But generally, most people start to feel better within 2-4 weeks of starting treatment. It's also important to note that Lyme disease can cause some long-term symptoms, such as joint pain or fatigue, even after treatment.
