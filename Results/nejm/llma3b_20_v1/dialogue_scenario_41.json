    "text": "Doctor, I think his appetite has been a bit more irregular lately, and he's been having trouble digesting certain foods. He's been experiencing more bloating and discomfort after meals, especially if he's eaten something high in sugar or processed ingredients. I'd like to request a review of his medical history, including any previous gastrointestinal issues or surgeries that might be relevant to his symptoms. Also, I'd like to ask, have you both noticed any changes in your husband's bowel movements or urinary habits since he started experiencing erectile dysfunction? Doctor: I see. It sounds like his digestive issues might be contributing to his erectile dysfunction. I'd like to explore some possible connections between the two. Can you tell me more about your husband's bowel movements and how often he's having them? Is there a pattern to when he's having them, or is it more sporadic? Patient: Well, I think his bowel movements have been a bit more irregular lately. Sometimes he's having them every other day, and sometimes he's not having them at all. And the consistency of his stool has been a bit off too - it's been more watery than usual. Doctor: Okay, that's helpful to know. I'd like to ask you a few more questions about his diet"
