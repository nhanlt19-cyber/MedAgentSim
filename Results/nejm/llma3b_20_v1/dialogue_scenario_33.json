Based on your symptoms, family history, and test results, I'm going to diagnose you with Renal Arteriovenous Malformation (RAVM). This condition is characterized by an abnormal connection between arteries and veins in the kidneys, which can lead to high blood pressure, proteinuria, and other complications. The systolic murmur you heard during your examination is likely due to the abnormal blood flow in the kidneys. The elevated urine osmolality and proteinuria also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the family history of kidney problems and hypertension in your relatives increases the likelihood of RAVM. I would like to discuss the treatment options with you and your parents. We may need to perform further testing, such as an angiogram or a MRI, to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the malformation. We may also need to start medication to control your blood pressure and proteinuria. I would like to request a review of your renal function again, just to make sure everything looks normal.

    "text": "\"Okay, I think we've covered everything. Based on your symptoms, family history, and test results, I'm going to diagnose you with Renal Arteriovenous Malformation (RAVM). This condition is characterized by an abnormal connection between arteries and veins in the kidneys, which can lead to high blood pressure, proteinuria, and other complications. The systolic murmur you heard during your examination is likely due to the abnormal blood flow in the kidneys. The elevated urine osmolality and proteinuria also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the family history of kidney problems and hypertension in your relatives increases the likelihood of RAVM.
