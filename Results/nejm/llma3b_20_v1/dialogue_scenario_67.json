You would need to come to the hospital for treatment every few days, and you would need to rest and recover between treatments. We would also need to discuss the potential side effects of chemotherapy with you and your family, such as hair loss, fatigue, and nausea. We would need to talk about how to manage these side effects and what support systems are in place to help you and your family during this time. In addition to chemotherapy, we may also discuss other treatment options, such as radiation therapy or a bone marrow transplant.

    "text": "Chemotherapy is a type of treatment that uses medication to kill cancer cells in your body. It's not a medicine that will make you feel better, but rather a way to target and destroy the cancer cells that are causing your symptoms. Think of it like a strong medicine that attacks the bad guys, the cancer cells, in your body. But, just like with any medicine, chemotherapy can have side effects, which can affect how you feel and what you can do. We'll do our best to minimize the side effects and make sure you're comfortable throughout the treatment process. Now, let's talk about what to expect during your chemotherapy sessions. You'll come to the hospital for treatment every few days, and we'll give you the medication through an IV. You'll need to rest and recover between treatments, and we'll provide you with instructions on how to manage any side effects you may experience. We'll also be monitoring your progress closely to make sure the treatment is working and to adjust the treatment plan as needed. Can you tell me more about your current pain level? How is the leg pain affecting you, and are there any specific activities or positions that make it better or worse?"

Will I be able to eat and drink during treatment, or will I have to fast beforehand? Doctor: We'll be scheduling your first chemotherapy session for tomorrow morning, and we'll make sure that your parents are aware of the plan. You'll be able to go home afterwards, but we'll need to monitor your progress closely for the next few hours to make sure you're not experiencing any severe side effects. We'll also provide you with a list of medications to take at home to help manage any side effects you may experience. Patient: Okay, that sounds good. What about my friends? Will I be able to see them during treatment? Doctor: We'll make sure that you're able to see your friends during treatment, but we may need to adjust your schedule to accommodate your treatment sessions. We'll work with your parents to make sure that you're able to spend time with your friends and family during this time. Patient: Okay, that sounds good. I just want to get better and feel better.

This is just to help the medication work more effectively. As for fasting, we usually don't require it, but we may ask you to avoid eating or drinking for about an hour before your treatment session. We'll also provide you with a list of foods that are okay to eat during treatment, as some foods can interact with the medication.
