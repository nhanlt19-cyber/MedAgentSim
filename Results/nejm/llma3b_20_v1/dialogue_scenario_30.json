As for the medication, I want to assure you that it's easy to administer and the side effects are usually mild. However, we'll need to monitor the baby's response to the medication and adjust the dosage as needed. Regarding the medication, the bronchodilator I mentioned earlier will be easy to administer, and the side effects are usually mild. However, we'll need to monitor the baby's response to the medication and adjust the dosage as needed. You'll need to give the medication to the baby orally, usually once a day, and we'll provide you with detailed instructions on how to administer it. I also want to reassure you that we'll be providing you with a medication list and instructions on how to administer the medication at home, so you can feel more comfortable giving it to the baby. We'll also be scheduling regular check-ups with the baby's pediatrician to monitor its progress and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. In the meantime, I"

As for the stool and urine output, I don't think there have been any changes, but the mom did mention that it's been having trouble clearing its airways. The baby's been making a lot of grunting noises and its face is scrunched up in distress. It's still making those noises even when the mom is holding it, but it does seem to calm down a bit when she's holding it close.\""

    "text": "\"Okay, thank you for the update, mom. Based on the information gathered, I'm going to make a diagnosis of Congenital Pulmonary Artery Stenosis (CPAS). This condition is characterized by a narrowing of the pulmonary artery, which can cause respiratory distress and other symptoms in newborns. The symptoms you've described, such as grunting noises, retractions, and peripheral cyanosis, are consistent with CPAS. As we discussed earlier, the surgical team has reviewed the baby's case and is expecting to schedule the surgery within the next 24-48 hours. The surgery will involve widening the pulmonary artery to improve blood flow to the lungs and alleviate the symptoms. In the meantime, we'll continue to monitor the baby's oxygen saturation levels, heart rate, and blood pressure closely, and adjust the treatment plan as needed. We'll also provide the mom with educational materials and resources to help her care for the baby at home. I want to reassure you that we're doing everything we can to help the baby, and we're committed to providing the best possible care. We'll be with you every step of the way, and we'll keep you updated on the baby's progress. Now, let's review the emergency contact information and make sure we"

Can you please tell me more about what to expect during the surgery and what kind of anesthesia will be used? And what about the possibility of complications? Are there any risks involved with the surgery that we should be aware of?\""
