It's common in people who are overweight or have a history of repetitive strain injuries. The sensation of resistance you felt in your knee when you were playing volleyball could be related to this condition.

The good news is that Chondromalacia Patellae is a relatively common condition, and with the right treatment, you can start to see improvements in your knee pain within a few weeks to a few months. In terms of lifestyle changes, it's essential to avoid activities that aggravate the pain, such as jumping, running, or any other high-impact exercises that put stress on your knee joint. Instead, focus on low-impact exercises like cycling, swimming, or even yoga. These activities can help strengthen your quadriceps muscles and improve your knee mobility without putting excessive stress on the joint. As for preventing further damage, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure to wear a knee brace or support when engaging in any physical activity that might aggravate the pain. This can help stabilize the kneecap and reduce stress on the joint. Additionally, consider incorporating exercises that strengthen your core and hip muscles, as these muscles play a crucial role in supporting the knee joint. In terms of the treatment plan, I'd like to prescribe a combination of anti-inflammatory medications and physical therapy to help improve your knee mobility and strength.

Can you sit down in the leg press machine and push the platform away from you with your feet, extending your legs? Then, slowly lower the platform back down to the starting position. Repeat this motion 10-15 times. Now, let's talk about some adjustments you can make to help you feel more comfortable. One thing you can try is to take a few deep breaths before standing up or bearing weight on your knee. This can help relax your muscles and reduce any discomfort you may be feeling.
