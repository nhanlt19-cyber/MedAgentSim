The key findings that led us to this diagnosis are: * Your symptoms of a pruritic rash on the bilateral upper extremities, which are consistent with contact dermatitis. * The presence of an intraepidermal accumulation of edematous fluid and widening of intercellular spaces between keratinocytes in the skin biopsy findings, which is consistent with an allergic reaction. * The fact that the rash tends to worsen when you're exposed to certain substances, such as fragrances and dyes, which is also consistent with contact dermatitis. * The positive results on the fragrance sensitivity test, which confirms that you have a sensitivity to fragrances.
