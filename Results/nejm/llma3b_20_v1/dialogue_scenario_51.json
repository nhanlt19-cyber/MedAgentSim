This is a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver, leading to liver enlargement, fatigue, and other symptoms. I also notice that your ACTH level is elevated, which suggests that your adrenal gland may be overactive, possibly leading to Cushing's syndrome. However, this is not the primary cause of your symptoms. Given your symptoms of rapid breathing, liver enlargement, and pitting edema, I believe that your primary condition is fatty liver disease. I would like to discuss treatment options with your mom to see what we can do to help manage your symptoms and improve your overall health. In the meantime, I would like to request one more test: REQUEST TEST: Genetic Panel to see if we can identify any underlying genetic causes of your fatty liver disease. Doctor: I'd like to take a closer look at your symptoms again. Can you tell me more about how you're feeling when you're resting? Do you feel any better when you're lying down, or does it seem to make your symptoms worse? Patient: \"Uh, doc, I think it makes my symptoms worse when I'm lying down."
