Try to write down as much as you can, and don't worry if it doesn't make sense at first. We can work on it together later. Also, I want you to try to take a few deep breaths whenever you feel yourself getting overwhelmed or stressed. You can do this by inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling slowly through your mouth. It's a simple trick, but it can really help calm you down. And remember, if you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed, it's okay to take a break and do something you enjoy. Whether it's playing with your sister, watching a funny video, or just taking a few minutes to relax, make sure you're taking care of yourself. Can you tell me what you think you'll do to take care of yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed?\" Patient: \"Uh-huh, doc. I think I'll take a few deep breaths and try to think about things in a more rational way. I'll also try to focus on things that make me happy and calm me down, like playing with my sister or watching a funny video.\" Doctor: \"That's"

Remember that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can. Don't be too hard on yourself when you slip up, but instead, try to learn from your mistakes and move forward. Also, try to focus on the present moment and what you can control, rather than worrying about the past or future. Take things one step at a time, and remember that you can always come back to me or your parents and teacher for support if you need it. Now, I think that's all the questions I have for today. I'm going to make a note to speak with your parents and teacher about our conversation today, and I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment with you in a few weeks to check in on your progress.

Remember, self-compassion is key to managing your emotions and behaviors. Now, I'd like to give you a small gift to remind you of our conversation today. It's a small stuffed animal that represents calmness and focus. Can you hold it for me?\" Patient: \"Uh-huh, doc. I'll hold it.\" Doctor: \"Great. Now, I want you to keep this stuffed animal with you at all times as a reminder of our conversation today. Whenever you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed, just hold onto this and take a few deep breaths. Remember, you're not alone and there's always support available to you.\" Patient: \"Okay, doc.

And focusing on the present moment and what you can control is a great way to reduce stress and anxiety. Remember, you can't control everything, but you can control how you respond to situations. By focusing on what you can control, you can feel more calm and in control. Now, I'd like to give you a small homework assignment to continue working on your self-compassion skills. I want you to write down three things you can be kind to yourself about today.
