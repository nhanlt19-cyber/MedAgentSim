I've also been trying to avoid activities that make it worse, like sitting for long periods of time or going up and down stairs. I've been using a cane to help with balance and support, especially in the mornings when I'm most active. Doctor: I see. And have you noticed any changes in your knee joint or surrounding tissues since the pain started? Are there any areas that feel tender or inflamed? Patient: Yeah, I've noticed that the swelling is getting worse over time, and it's getting harder to move my knee without feeling pain. But like I said, it's not just the swelling, it's the dull ache that's really bothering me."

It appears that you're suffering from a condition known as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Type II, also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). This condition is characterized by chronic pain, swelling, and sensitivity in the affected limb, often accompanied by fatigue, sleep disturbances, and changes in bowel habits. The MRI findings of a lesion in the distal femur are consistent with this diagnosis. While the exact cause of the lesion is unclear, it's possible that it's related to the inflammation and damage caused by the CRPS. I want to assure you that CRPS is a treatable condition, and with the right management, you can learn to live with it and improve your quality of life. We'll work together to develop a treatment plan that addresses your pain, swelling, and other symptoms. In the meantime, I recommend that you continue to take your ibuprofen as directed, but also consider alternative pain management options, such as physical therapy, acupuncture, or cognitive-behavioral therapy. We'll also work on addressing any sleep disturbances and changes in bowel habits. I'd"
