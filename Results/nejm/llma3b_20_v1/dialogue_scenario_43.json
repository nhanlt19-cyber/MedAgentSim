In terms of treatment, we'll likely need to start with antibiotics to kill off the excess bacteria in your small intestine. We may also need to add probiotics to help restore the balance of good bacteria in your gut. I'll also recommend dietary changes, such as following a low-FODMAP diet, to help reduce symptoms. Regarding the kidney impairment, it's likely that the dehydration and electrolyte imbalances associated with SIBO are contributing to the elevated creatinine and BUN levels in your blood work. We can work on addressing these imbalances through dietary changes and supplements, such as potassium and magnesium. However, it's also possible that there may be an underlying kidney issue that needs to be addressed.
