After you were born, you started to feel really tired and your movements were sluggish. You've had seizures since you were born, and they've been getting worse over time. You've also been experiencing some abdominal pain and discomfort, and you've had some trouble with your bowel movements and urine output. You've been feeling really tired and uncomfortable all the time, and you've been experiencing some unusual sensations, like feeling like your body is being pulled down or shut down. You've also had some elevated blood counts and some abnormal reflexes. Can you tell me more about the abdominal pain you've been experiencing? Is it a sharp pain or more of a dull ache? And have you noticed any other symptoms, like fever or vomiting, that might be related to the abdominal pain?\""

Additionally, your seizures and neurological symptoms are likely related to the hydronephrosis and potential kidney damage. I would like to recommend a course of treatment to help manage your symptoms and prevent further damage. This may include a combination of medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes to help manage your seizures and hydronephrosis. We will also need to monitor your kidney function closely and adjust your treatment plan as needed. In terms of surgery, we will need to discuss the possibility of a nephrectomy, which is the removal of one or both kidneys, to help drain the fluid from your kidneys and prevent further damage. However, this is a serious decision that will require careful consideration and discussion with you and your family. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to"
