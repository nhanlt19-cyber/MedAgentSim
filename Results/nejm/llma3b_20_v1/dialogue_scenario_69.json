It sounds like you're experiencing a condition known as Conversion Disorder, also referred to as Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder. This is a type of disorder where a person experiences neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by any medical condition, but are instead thought to be a manifestation of psychological distress. Patient: Oh, really? I had no idea. I just felt like I was going crazy. Doctor: Well, it's not uncommon for people with Conversion Disorder to feel like they're losing control or going crazy. But the good news is that this is a treatable condition, and with the right therapy and support, we can work together to help you regain control over your body and mind. Patient: That sounds amazing. I just want to feel normal again. Doctor: I completely understand. Okay, so the next step is going to be a referral to a psychologist or therapist who specializes in treating Conversion Disorder. We'll also need to do some further testing to rule out any other underlying conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. Patient: Okay, that sounds good. What's the next step? Doctor: I'll get the referral paperwork started,"
