Orthorexia Nervosa is a condition where individuals become excessively preoccupied with healthy eating and may experience feelings of guilt, shame, and anxiety when they can't follow their strict diet. It's a complex condition that requires professional help and support. I've reviewed your test results, and while your thyroid function and vitamin D levels are within normal limits, your blood sugar level is elevated, which may indicate a link to your eating habits. I'd like to refer you to a registered dietitian and a therapist who specialize in eating disorders. They can help you develop a healthier relationship with food and work through the underlying issues that may be contributing to your symptoms. In the meantime, I want to assure you that you're not defined by your eating habits or your cravings. You are a complex individual with many strengths and talents, and I believe in your ability to recover and thrive. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to review your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed. In the meantime, please reach out to me or my team if you have any questions"
