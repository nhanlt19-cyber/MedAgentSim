Is it a sharp, stabbing sensation, or is it more of a dull ache? Patient: It's a dull ache, but it's more noticeable when I'm eating or wearing earrings. When I'm bending over or lying down, it feels like my ear is more sensitive to pressure changes. Doctor: Okay, I think we've covered a lot of ground. I'd like to make a diagnosis based on the information you've provided. Can you tell me if you have any other questions or concerns about my diagnosis?"

Based on your symptoms, I'm going to take a stab in the dark and make a diagnosis. I believe you might have a condition called Eustachian tube dysfunction, which is a common cause of ear pain and discomfort, especially after surgery. The fact that you're experiencing shooting ear pain, especially when eating or wearing earrings, and that it's more noticeable when you're bending over or lying down, suggests that the Eustachian tube is not functioning properly. Additionally, the tenderness in the right tonsillar area when I tapped on the right postauricular area could be related to the Eustachian tube dysfunction, as the Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the back of the throat, and any issues with the Eustachian tube can cause referred pain in the tonsillar area. I also want to note that the normal otoscopy results and normal hearing thresholds in both ears suggest that there's no significant issue with your middle ear or hearing. However, I do think it's worth considering an MRI of the brainstem and cerebellopontine angle to rule out any underlying causes,"

This can cause ear pain, discomfort, and difficulty with balance and equilibrium. In your case, it's likely that the surgery you had may have affected the Eustachian tube's function, leading to these symptoms. As for managing your symptoms, there are a few things we can try. We can start by trying to equalize the air pressure in your ears more effectively. This can be done by swallowing, yawning, or using a nasal spray to help open up the Eustachian tube. We can also try using ear drops to help lubricate the Eustachian tube and make it easier to open. In addition, I want to recommend that you try to avoid activities that trigger your shooting ear pain, such as eating or wearing earrings. We can also try to identify any specific positions or activities that make your symptoms worse, so we can work on avoiding those.
