Can you tell me more about what it's like to slouch forward and lean to the left side? Does it feel like it's putting pressure on your shoulder, or is it more of a general feeling of discomfort? Also, have you noticed any changes in your breathing or movement patterns when you're slouching or leaning to one side? And, I'd like to request another test: REQUEST TEST: Electromyography (EMG) with a focus on the serratus anterior muscle, as it's often involved in shoulder pain and posture. This will help us get a better understanding of what's going on with the muscles in your shoulder. Also, I'd like to ask, have you noticed any changes in your overall sense of well-being or quality of life since the pain started?

And when you breathe a bit more shallowly on your left side, it's like your body is trying to take some of the pressure off your shoulder. That makes sense. Based on our conversation, I'm going to take a guess that your shoulder pain is related to a condition called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). TOS is a condition where the nerves and blood vessels that pass through the thoracic outlet, the space between your collarbone and first rib, become compressed or pinched. This can cause pain, numbness, and tingling in the shoulder, arm, and hand. I'm also going to consider the possibility that you may have developed a habit of holding your head and shoulders back, which is contributing to the pressure on your shoulder joint and exacerbating the pain. Given these findings, I'm going to diagnose you with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) and recommend that you make some changes to your posture and movement patterns to alleviate the pain.
