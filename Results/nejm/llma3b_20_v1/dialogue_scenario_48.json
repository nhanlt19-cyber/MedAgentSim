I'm going to have to make a diagnosis based on the information you've provided. Based on our conversation, I'm going to diagnose you with Hemophilia A, a genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. This condition can cause easy bruising, heavy bleeding, and prolonged bleeding after injuries, which are all symptoms you've been experiencing. I'd like to discuss treatment options with you and answer any questions you may have.\" \"Okay, so you're saying I have Hemophilia A? What does that mean, exactly?

This means that your blood has difficulty clotting, which can lead to easy bruising, heavy bleeding, and prolonged bleeding after injuries. Treatment for Hemophilia A typically involves replacing the missing clotting factors with clotting factor concentrates, which can be administered intravenously or through an injection. In"
