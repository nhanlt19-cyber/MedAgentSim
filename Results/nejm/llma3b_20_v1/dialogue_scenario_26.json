If the kidney function test shows any abnormalities, we may need to consider further testing, such as an imaging study or a biopsy, to determine the cause of the issue. We may also need to adjust your medication regimen, including your lithium, to ensure that it's not contributing to any kidney problems. In the meantime, I'd like to review the results of the kidney function test as soon as they come back. I'll also discuss the lithium level test results with you and make any necessary adjustments to your medication. Can you tell me more about your anxiety levels regarding the test results?

We'll also discuss ways to manage your stress and anxiety, as we've noticed that your bipolar disorder has been exacerbating your symptoms. In terms of medications, we'll start with pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help manage your symptoms. We may also consider muscle relaxants or immunosuppressants to help reduce inflammation and promote healing in the bladder.

We recommend increasing your fluid intake to at least 8-10 glasses of water per day. This will help to keep your bladder muscles relaxed and prevent dehydration. As for pelvic floor exercises, we recommend doing Kegel exercises 3-4 times a day to help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles.
