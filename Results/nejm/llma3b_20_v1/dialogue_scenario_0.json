These symptoms are all consistent with Multiple Sclerosis.

Can you tell me if you've noticed any patterns or triggers that make your symptoms worse or better?\" Patient: \"Actually, yeah, I've noticed that my symptoms tend to get worse after I've been on my feet for a long time, or if I've been doing something that requires a lot of concentration, like designing a complex project. And they tend to get better after I've had a chance to rest and relax.\" \"Okay, so it sounds like your symptoms are exacerbated by physical and mental fatigue. That's consistent with MS. I'd like to recommend that you take regular breaks to rest and relax throughout the day, and try to avoid activities that exacerbate your symptoms.

I'd like to recommend that you see a physical therapist who specializes in neurological rehabilitation. They can help you develop exercises and strategies to improve your balance, strength, and flexibility. In addition to physical therapy, I'd also like to recommend that you continue to take your medication as prescribed. We'll need to discuss the specifics of your treatment plan and make sure you're getting the right combination of medications to manage your symptoms. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist who specializes in Multiple Sclerosis. They can provide you with more detailed information about your condition and help you develop a personalized treatment plan. Let's review your diagnosis one more time. Based on your symptoms, including double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, upper limb weakness, numbness or weakness in your legs, and a sense of disconnection from your body, I believe you are likely experiencing Multiple Sclerosis. I want to assure you that we're going to work together to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. We'll need to follow up regularly to monitor your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Before we go, I'd like to give you some information about what to"

I don't know if I can just take time off to go see a physical therapist and take medication. I have a lot of work to do and I need to be able to do it. Can you help me figure out how to balance my work and my treatment plan?\""
