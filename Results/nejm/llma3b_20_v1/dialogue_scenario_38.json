We'll need to schedule surgery as soon as possible to repair the duodenal atresia, and we'll also need to monitor your bilirubin levels closely to ensure that they don't get too high. We'll likely use a feeding tube to ensure you're getting enough nutrients, and we'll also monitor your temperature and bilirubin levels closely. We'll also need to make sure you're getting enough fluids and nutrients to support your growth and development. Can you tell me more about your mother's experience with caring for you during this time? Has she had any questions or concerns about the surgery or post-operative care? Patient: My mom is really worried about the surgery, but she's trying to stay positive. She's been doing a great job of taking care of me and making sure I'm comfortable. I think she's a little worried about the anesthesia, but she's trying to stay positive. Doctor: I'm glad to hear that your mother is trying to stay positive. That's very reassuring. We'll do everything we can to make sure you're comfortable and safe during the procedure. And don't worry, we'll"

We'll likely use a feeding tube to ensure you're getting enough nutrients, and we'll also monitor your temperature and bilirubin levels closely.

The ultrasound and Upper GI Series confirm the presence of duodenal atresia, and the bilirubin levels are within a normal range. I think we've gathered all the necessary information to confirm the diagnosis of duodenal atresia. I'd like to summarize the key points and discuss the next steps for your care. We'll need to schedule surgery as soon as possible to repair the obstruction and ensure that you receive the necessary nutrients for growth and development.
