The Behavioral Assessment Survey and Psychological Evaluation findings support this diagnosis, indicating patterns consistent with oppositional behaviors without conduct problems. The patient's desire for autonomy and control over their daily routine is also a significant factor in their behavior.\n\nNote: Cholecystitis is not mentioned in the discussion as a possible diagnosis, and it is a condition related to inflammation of the gallbladder, which is unrelated to the patient's symptoms and behaviors described in the conversation."
