The presence of erythematous plaques with crusting and oozing, combined with the biopsy results showing cells with nuclear hyperchromasia, multinucleation, and increased mitotic figures, supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of smoking and potential UV radiation exposure also contribute to the likelihood of SCC.\n\nThe mention of Cholecystitis as a final diagnosis is not supported by the discussion, as none of the doctors mentioned it as a possible diagnosis. The discussion focused on skin cancer, specifically SCC, as the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and test results."
