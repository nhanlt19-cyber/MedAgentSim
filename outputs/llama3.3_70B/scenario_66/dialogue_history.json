The normal test results help rule out other potential causes, leading the team to consider conditions directly related to prematurity. While some suggestions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are mentioned, the primary focus remains on complications arising from prematurity, particularly anemia of prematurity, which is a common condition in preterm infants that can cause apnea episodes due to the insufficient production of red blood cells. The diagnosis of Cholecystitis is not supported by the discussion or findings presented."
