It seems to happen when I'm changing positions, like getting up from bed or standing up from a chair, and it's worse when I'm in a hurry or rushing to do something. Sometimes, if I'm sitting still for a while, it goes away on its own, but other times it can last for several minutes and leave me feeling quite unsteady."

I wouldn't say it's exactly lightheadedness, but more like my balance is off and I feel like I might fall over if I'm not careful.

No further testing or procedures are recommended at this time, and the patient will undergo the Epley maneuver as part of their treatment.

The positive Dix-Hallpike maneuver and the absence of any other underlying conditions or abnormalities on the tests further support this diagnosis.\n\nNote: Cholecystitis is not mentioned in the discussion among the doctors as a possible diagnosis, and all the evidence presented points towards BPPV as the most likely diagnosis."
