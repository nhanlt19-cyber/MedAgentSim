Although the test results were normal, it is noted that these tests do not always detect IC/BPS. The doctors also considered other potential diagnoses, such as Pelvic Floor Dysfunction (PFD) and vulvodynia, but the majority opinion leans towards IC/BPS.\n\nNote: Cholecystitis is not a likely diagnosis based on the discussion, as it is an inflammation of the gallbladder and does not match the patient's symptoms or test results."
