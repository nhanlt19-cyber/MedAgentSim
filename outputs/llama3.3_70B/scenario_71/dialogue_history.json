The normal readings from various tests help rule out certain inner ear pathologies but do not entirely exclude the possibility of a vestibular problem. The patient's response to diphenhydramine also supports this diagnosis.\n\nNote: Cholecystitis is not mentioned in the discussion among doctors and does not align with the presented symptoms and test results, which focus on vestibular and inner ear issues rather than gallbladder problems."
