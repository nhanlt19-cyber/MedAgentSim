The ground-glass appearance on the chest X-ray, air bronchograms, and the need for surfactant therapy and ventilator support all support this diagnosis. The arterial blood gas results showing respiratory acidosis also align with RDS. While some doctors considered other potential causes of respiratory distress, such as transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) or congenital pneumonia, the normal test results and clinical presentation make RDS the most likely diagnosis.\n\nNote: Cholecystitis is not a relevant diagnosis in this case, as it refers to inflammation of the gallbladder and is not related to the patient's symptoms or test results."
