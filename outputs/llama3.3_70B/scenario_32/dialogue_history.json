The consensus among the doctors points towards liver pathology given the elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and coagulopathy indicated by an elevated INR, but the exact cause remains to be determined with further diagnostic testing such as a Liver Biopsy and specific panels like the Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel."
