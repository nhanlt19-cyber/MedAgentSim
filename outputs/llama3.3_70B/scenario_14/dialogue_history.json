The mechanism of injury, symptoms, X-ray results, and preliminary MRI findings all support this diagnosis. Therefore, the final diagnosis is a mallet finger injury, which is a type of tendon injury that occurs when the extensor tendon on the back of the finger is stretched or torn. \n\nNote: Cholecystitis was mentioned at the end but it seems to be an error as it was not discussed by any of the doctors and does not match the symptoms or test results presented in the discussion."
