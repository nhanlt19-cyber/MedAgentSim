If we don't proceed with the surgery, there's a high risk that your testicle will become necrotic due to the lack of blood flow, which could lead to permanent damage or even loss of the testicle. As for the recovery time, it typically takes a few weeks to fully recover from the surgery, and I'm afraid you may have to sit out your upcoming football game.

As for the risks, there's a small chance of infection, bleeding, or damage to the surrounding tissues, but these are rare complications. Regarding fertility, if we're able to restore blood flow to the testicle promptly, the chances of normal fertility are generally good, but it's difficult to predict with certainty. Can you tell me if you have any questions about the anesthesia or the post-operative care, and are you ready to give your consent for the surgery?"

    "speaker": "Doctor",

As for the recovery process, we'll manage your pain with medication, and you can expect some discomfort, swelling, and bruising in the scrotal area, but this should subside within a few days. Can you tell me if you have any allergies or sensitivities to medications that I should be aware of before we proceed with the surgery?
