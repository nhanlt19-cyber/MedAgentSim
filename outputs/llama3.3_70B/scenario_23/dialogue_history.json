The normal test results from various diagnostic tests, including stool examination, colonoscopy, endoscopy, liver function tests, and electrolyte panel, also support this diagnosis. While some doctors mention considering other potential causes, such as infectious diarrhea or lactose intolerance, the majority of the discussion points towards IBS as the most likely diagnosis.\n\nNote: The initial analysis suggesting Cholecystitis is not supported by the discussion among the doctors, which consistently points towards a functional gastrointestinal disorder, specifically Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)."
