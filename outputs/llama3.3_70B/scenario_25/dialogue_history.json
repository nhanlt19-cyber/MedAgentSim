Although some doctors considered primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), the negative test results for autoimmune panels and the specific ultrasound findings lean more towards PSC. The provided final answer of Cholecystitis does not align with the discussion among the doctors, which focused more on conditions affecting the bile ducts rather than the gallbladder. Therefore, based on the collaborative discussion, Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is considered the most likely diagnosis."
