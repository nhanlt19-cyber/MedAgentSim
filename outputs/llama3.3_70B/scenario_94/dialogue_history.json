The evidence of venous reflux and obstruction, varicose veins, discoloration around the ankles, and swelling that worsens throughout the day all support this diagnosis. While some doctors considered other potential contributing factors, such as lymphedema or nerve compression, the consensus among the group is that CVI is the primary condition affecting the patient.\n\nNote: The mention of Cholecystitis in the prompt appears to be an error, as it was not discussed by any of the doctors and is unrelated to the symptoms and test results presented."
