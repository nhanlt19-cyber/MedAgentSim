The symptoms and test results discussed point towards a skin condition rather than a gastrointestinal issue like Cholecystitis.\n\nGiven the intense itching, red bumps worsening at night and after hot showers, improvement in symptoms away from home, and normal test results for common allergens and infections, the likely diagnosis based on the discussion seems to lean towards a condition such as dermatitis herpetiformis or another form of dermatitis, possibly irritant contact dermatitis due to environmental factors. However, without a clear consensus from the doctors' discussion provided, it's challenging to pinpoint a single diagnosis.\n\nTherefore, based on the information and the process of elimination of common allergens and infections through normal test results, a more accurate final diagnosis considering the skin symptoms described would be:\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Dermatitis ("
