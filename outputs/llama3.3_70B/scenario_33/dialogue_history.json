This condition can lead to high blood pressure, headaches, and leg symptoms such as stiffness and soreness after physical activity, which are all present in the patient's case. The normal results from other tests help rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, making coarctation of the aorta the most likely diagnosis.\n\nNote: Cholecystitis is not mentioned in the discussion among doctors, and the analysis does not support this diagnosis based on the provided information."
