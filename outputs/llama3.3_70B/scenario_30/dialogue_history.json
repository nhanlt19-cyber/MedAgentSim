The key findings that support this diagnosis include the patient's respiratory distress starting shortly after birth, grunting, chest retractions, and peripheral cyanosis, as well as the chest X-ray results showing a fine reticular granulation with a ground glass appearance on both lungs. The blood gas analysis results indicating a slightly acidic pH, elevated carbon dioxide levels, and reduced oxygen levels also support this diagnosis.\n\nThe mention of Cholecystitis is not relevant to the discussion and does not align with the patient's symptoms or test results. The doctors' consensus is clear that the patient is suffering from Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), which is a common condition in newborns, especially those who are premature or have surfactant deficiency."
