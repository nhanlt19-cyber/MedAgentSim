As for difficulty concentrating, yeah, it's been tough to focus on things like reading or watching TV, my mind just wanders off and I feel mentally exhausted.

Sometimes I'll be sitting there thinking about all the tests you're running and what the results might show, and that's when I feel my mind start to wander and get really anxious.
