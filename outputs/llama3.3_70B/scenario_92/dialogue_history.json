Based on the symptoms described (persistent cough with occasional yellowish mucus, streaks of blood in phlegm, steady weight loss, recurring fevers, night sweats, and general fatigue) and the normal test results for common infections, along with the patient's history of smoking and recent incarceration, a more likely diagnosis could be considered as lung cancer or another chronic pulmonary condition.
