The normal test results and symptom descriptions do not support a diagnosis of Cholecystitis. \n\nA more appropriate final diagnosis based on the discussion would be: Medication-Induced Movement Disorder, possibly akathisia or another risperidone-related side effect, with consideration of the patient's anxiety symptoms."
