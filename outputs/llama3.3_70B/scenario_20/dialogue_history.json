The presence of granular yellow-white opacities and dot-blot hemorrhages in the retina, combined with the patient's history of AIDS and significantly compromised immune system (CD4 count of 36/mm3), supports this diagnosis. While other conditions such as toxoplasmosis and HIV retinopathy are considered, CMV retinitis is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's clinical presentation and risk factors.\n\nNote: Cholecystitis is not a relevant diagnosis in this case, as it refers to inflammation of the gallbladder and is not related to the patient's symptoms or test results."
