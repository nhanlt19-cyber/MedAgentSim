Despite normal test results that might not strongly support this diagnosis, such as electronystagmography and VEMP testing, the clinical presentation aligns closely with BPPV. The mention of Cholecystitis seems unrelated to the discussion about vertigo and its causes, suggesting it may be an error or unrelated finding in this context. Therefore, based on the collaborative discussion among the doctors, BPPV emerges as the most likely diagnosis for the patient's condition."
