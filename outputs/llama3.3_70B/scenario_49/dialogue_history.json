The skin biopsy findings of epidermal necrosis and detachment, as well as the presence of ulcers and erythema in the oropharynx, further support this diagnosis.\n\nThe mention of Cholecystitis in the prompt appears to be an error, as it was not discussed by any of the doctors and does not align with the presented symptoms and test results. Therefore, based on the discussion and findings, the final diagnosis is a severe drug reaction."
