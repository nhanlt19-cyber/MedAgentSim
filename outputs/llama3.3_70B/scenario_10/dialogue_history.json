The presence of a palpable, non-tender, prolapsed mass identified during the anoscopy, the patient's history of multiple vaginal deliveries, and the consistency of the bleeding with bowel movements all support this diagnosis. Although some doctors suggest considering other potential sources of bleeding, the consensus leans towards internal hemorrhoids as the primary cause.
