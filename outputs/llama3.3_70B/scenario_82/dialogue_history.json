The elevated bilirubin levels, normal liver function tests, and lack of other alarming symptoms support this diagnosis. Although some doctors considered other potential causes such as breast milk jaundice or underlying infections, the majority opinion is that physiological jaundice is the most likely cause of the newborn's jaundice.\n\nThe initial analysis suggesting Cholecystitis as the diagnosis does not align with the discussion among the doctors, as Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) was not considered a potential diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and test results."
