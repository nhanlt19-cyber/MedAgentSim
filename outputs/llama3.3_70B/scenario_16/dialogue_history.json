The absence of fever, vomiting, blood or mucus in the stool, and normal inflammatory markers further support this diagnosis. Although some doctors initially considered an infectious or inflammatory cause, the comprehensive array of tests with normal results led them to lean towards a functional gastrointestinal disorder like IBS. \n\nNote: Cholecystitis was mentioned as a possible answer but it is not supported by the discussion among the doctors, as none of them mentioned symptoms or test results consistent with cholecystitis, such as right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, or elevated liver enzymes."
