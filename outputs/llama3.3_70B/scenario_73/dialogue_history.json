Based on the symptoms and test results presented, the majority of the doctors suggest that the patient's condition is related to impulse control, emotional regulation, and potential neurodevelopmental or psychiatric issues. The normal test results from various medical panels help rule out underlying medical conditions, but the patient's behavioral changes, lack of empathy, and cognitive impairment point towards a complex psychological or psychiatric condition.\n\nConsidering the opinions of the doctors, the most likely diagnosis is not explicitly stated in the discussion, but potential diagnoses mentioned include frontotemporal dementia, borderline personality disorder, impulse control disorder, eating disorder, depressive disorder, or neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder. However, without a clear consensus, it's challenging to pinpoint a single diagnosis.\n\nGiven the information provided and the process of elimination based on normal test results for various medical conditions, a more appropriate approach would be to consider diagnoses that align"
