This diagnosis is supported by the temporal association between the onset of symptoms and the antibiotic use, despite normal test results across various panels. The lack of response to the drug reaction screening and IgE allergy panel suggests that a typical allergic mechanism might not be at play, but the clinical presentation is consistent with an immune-mediated response to the medication. Cholecystitis was mentioned as a possible diagnosis in the prompt, but it was not discussed by the doctors and does not match the patient's symptoms."
