Although the normal test results, including fungal cultures and autoimmune disorder panels, complicate this diagnosis, the doctors suggest that external factors such as hair care products or environmental conditions may be exacerbating the condition. The mention of Cholecystitis is not supported by the discussion, as it is a condition related to the gallbladder and does not match the symptoms or test results presented."
