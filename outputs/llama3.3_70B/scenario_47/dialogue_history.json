The absence of significant inflammation and normal results from tests such as rheumatoid factor and ESR also support this diagnosis. The mention of Cholecystitis is not supported by the discussion and appears to be an error, as it is a condition related to the gallbladder and was not mentioned in the doctors' analysis."
