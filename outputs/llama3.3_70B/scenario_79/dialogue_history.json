The presence of these bacteria in the bloodstream is a significant indicator of an active infection, and the patient's pregnancy status increases the risk for severe outcomes if left untreated. Despite some normal test results, the key evidence from the blood cultures and the clinical presentation points towards listeriosis as the primary diagnosis. \n\nNote: Cholecystitis was mentioned at the end but it seems to be an error as none of the discussion pointed towards this diagnosis. The entire discussion was focused on the symptoms and lab results indicating a Listeria infection."
