The symptoms such as thick and yellow-green mucus production, worsening of cough in the morning, and improvement with antibiotics but not inhalers are consistent with this diagnosis. Although other possibilities like rare conditions, environmental factors, restrictive lung disease, functional disorders, or psychogenic cough were considered, the overall consensus leans towards Idiopathic Chronic Cough as the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided.\n\nNote: The mention of Cholecystitis in the user's query does not align with the discussion among the doctors, which focuses on respiratory symptoms and tests rather than symptoms related to the gallbladder."
