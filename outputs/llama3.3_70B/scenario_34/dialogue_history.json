The normal test results and the patient's symptoms, such as a pruritic rash and improvement with warm baths, supported this diagnosis. While some doctors considered a viral etiology, the lack of specific findings from the tests made it less likely. Cholecystitis was not mentioned in the discussion as a possible diagnosis, and the patient's symptoms did not align with this condition. Therefore, based on the majority vote, the final diagnosis is Atopic Dermatitis (Eczema) or Irritant/Allergic Contact Dermatitis."
