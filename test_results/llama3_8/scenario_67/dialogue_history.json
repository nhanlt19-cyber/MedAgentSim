I want to feel like myself again.\n\nI want to reassure you that we're making progress, and I'm starting to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Can you tell me more about your sleep patterns lately? Have you been sleeping well at night, or are you waking up frequently?\n\nSometimes I wake up in the middle of the night because my legs hurt, doctor. And sometimes I have bad dreams.\n\nI see. It sounds like you're having a tough time with sleep. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or emotions lately? Are you feeling sad"
