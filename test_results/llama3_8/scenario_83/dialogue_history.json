    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been kind of... unpredictable, I guess. Sometimes my hands feel fine, and then suddenly they feel really stiff and heavy again. It's like they're just waiting for me to do something with them, but they just can't seem to cooperate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You mentioned the numbness or tingling sensations come and go. Can you tell me if these sensations are confined to one side of your body or are they bilateral?"

  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "These numbness or tingling sensations are more pronounced on the left side of your body. Can you tell me if you've experienced any weakness or paralysis in that same left side?"

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I think I've had a bit of weakness on my left side, but it's hard to tell because everything feels so... rigid. It's like my whole body is one big, solid muscle that I'm trying to move, but it's not cooperating very well.\n\nDo you think it's possible for me to have some kind of... neurological issue, given my history of tics and all?\n\nI've been feeling really anxious and irritable lately, and it's been hard for me to control my emotions. Could that be related to what's going on with my body?\n\nI've been having trouble sleeping at night, and when I do sleep, I have these really vivid and disturbing dreams. Is that normal?"

  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So the numbness or tingling sensations are more pronounced on the left side of your body, and you've also experienced weakness or paralysis in that same left side.

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've been feeling really unsteady on my feet, like I'm always on the verge of falling over. It's hard for me to walk or stand without feeling like I'm going to lose my balance. And it's not just my legs, it feels like my whole body is off-balance."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "With this being our final question, I must say that I've gathered a lot of valuable information, but there's still one crucial piece of information I need to consider: the recent diagnosis of a patient with similar symptoms being cancer. \n\nCan you tell me, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?"
