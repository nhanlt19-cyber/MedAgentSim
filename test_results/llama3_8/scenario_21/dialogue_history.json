Your history of joint pain, particularly in the left ankle, combined with the recent onset of pain and swelling in the right knee, is concerning. Additionally, the changes in your urinary habits and the presence of redness and swelling around the knee are red flags.\n\nConsidering the recent diagnosis of a patient with similar symptoms and a diagnosis of cancer, I have to consider this possibility in your case as well. I've taken note of your recent travel and exposure to others, but it's also possible that this could be an autoimmune disorder or an infection.\n\nI'm going to take a moment to review the test results and your medical history. REQUEST TEST: Complete_Blood_Count."
