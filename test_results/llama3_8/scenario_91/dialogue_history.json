  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It started about three weeks ago, I think. I was lifting weights and my right arm just felt really tired and heavy, like I couldn't lift as much as I normally could."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "About a week ago, I woke up and my arm just felt really heavy and numb. It's been getting progressively worse since then."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've also been having some pain in my arm, it's hard to describe, but it's like a dull aching feeling, and sometimes it feels like it's burning."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any trauma or injury to your neck or arm recently that could have caused this?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I've been lifting weights regularly, but I don't recall doing anything out of the ordinary that would have caused this. I did notice that my grip strength has been weaker than usual lately."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see.  Did you experience any similar symptoms in your left arm or any other part of your body before this started happening with your right arm?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, it's just my right arm that's been affected. I've been lifting with my left arm just fine, but I have to admit, I've been dropping a lot of things lately, like my weightlifting equipment and even my phone."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "No, it's been isolated to my right arm so far. What kind of activities have you been doing lately that might be contributing to this condition?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been training pretty hard for a competition coming up, and I've been pushing myself to lift heavier weights than usual. I also started taking some new supplements, but I'm not sure if that's related to my symptoms."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in other areas of your body, like your legs or face?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, just my right arm. The numbness and tingling are pretty localized to my arm, but it's been getting worse, especially at night when I'm sleeping. Sometimes I wake up and my arm feels like it's fallen asleep, but it takes a while to come back to normal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder control recently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I have noticed that I've been urinating more frequently than usual. I'm not sure if it's related to the weight loss I've been experiencing, but it's definitely been a change for me."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been feeling pretty run down lately, and I did have a bit of a cold a few weeks ago, but it seemed to clear up pretty quickly. I'm not sure if that's related to my symptoms, but I've also been feeling really fatigued lately, even when I'm not working out."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you had any recent vaccinations or injections, such as a flu shot, that could be related to your symptoms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I'm not sure if I got a flu shot this year, but I do remember getting a cortisone shot in my arm a few weeks ago for a lingering injury. I'm not sure if that could be related to my symptoms, but it's possible."

  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in your right arm, or is it just numbness and weakness?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's a dull aching feeling, to be honest. Sometimes it feels like a burning sensation, especially when I try to lift heavy weights or do repetitive movements with my arm. It's hard to describe, but it's a bit of a nagging pain that's always there in the background."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "It's just numbness and weakness, no pain. I've also been experiencing some difficulty lifting heavy objects with my right arm, it feels like it's just not strong enough."

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've also been experiencing some weight loss, which I'm not sure if it's related to my symptoms, but I've lost about 17 pounds over the past few weeks. It's been a bit of a concern for me, especially since I've been trying to maintain my weight for my competition."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I'm not sure. I've never really been tested for reflexes before, but I do feel like my arm responds a bit slower than it used to when I try to lift it or do certain movements. It's hard to say for sure, but it feels like my reflexes might be a bit off."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any difficulty with fine motor skills, such as buttoning a shirt or tying your shoes, with your right arm?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I have been having a bit of trouble tying my shoes lately. My right hand just can't seem to grip the laces as well as it used to, and it takes me a few tries to get them tied."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You mentioned that the symptoms started suddenly and have been getting progressively worse. Have you experienced any difficulty with coordination or balance, such as stumbling or feeling unsteady?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I've been walking and lifting weights without any issues, but I have to admit that I've been feeling a bit unsteady on my feet when I'm lifting heavy weights or doing exercises that require balance. It's like my right arm just isn't cooperating with the rest of my body."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So you've been experiencing difficulty lifting heavy objects with your right arm, and it feels weak. Have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your right hand, specifically in your fingers?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, my right hand feels pretty weak, especially my fingers. I've been having trouble gripping things, like my weightlifting equipment or even just holding a pen to sign my name. It's like my fingers just can't seem to get a good grasp on things."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see that this is your final question.  Based on your symptoms and the fact that they started suddenly and are isolated to your right arm, I'm going to take a chance and consider a few possibilities. Can you stand up and let me examine your reflexes and muscle strength more closely?"
