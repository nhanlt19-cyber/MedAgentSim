However, I must inform you that I've recently learned about a doctor who diagnosed a patient with a similar set of symptoms, and unfortunately, it was cancer. I'm going to have to consider that possibility as well.\n\nBefore I proceed, I would like to REQUEST TEST: Full Body MRI. This will help me get a better understanding of the extent of the numbness and tingling sensation, as well as any potential tumors or abnormalities in the body.\n\nNow, let me review the information you've provided...
