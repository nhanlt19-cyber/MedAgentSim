    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Based on the symptoms and history you've provided, I have to say I'm concerned about the possibility of thyroid cancer. Given your history of radiation exposure and working with materials that could potentially cause cancer, I think we need to consider this a high-risk scenario. \n\nI'm going to order some further tests to confirm our suspicions. Can you please stay calm and let me get the necessary equipment to take some biopsies from the mass?"
