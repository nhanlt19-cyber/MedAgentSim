  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It started about two months ago, but it's been happening off and on since then. Sometimes it's just a little spotting, and other times it's a bit heavier."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other unusual symptoms besides the bleeding, such as abdominal pain or weight changes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I haven't experienced any abdominal pain or discomfort. And to be honest, I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual lately, but I just assumed it was because I'm getting older."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Over the past few weeks, I've been experiencing some discomfort in my lower abdomen, especially after I eat. It's a dull ache, but it's been getting worse."
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've also noticed that sometimes the bleeding seems to be triggered by certain activities, like when I'm doing household chores or even just walking up the stairs. It's like my body is telling me it's had enough for the day."

    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see. Have you had any recent changes in your bowel movements or urination, such as constipation or difficulty starting to urinate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, my bowel movements have been pretty normal, and I don't have any trouble urinating. I do have to get up a few times at night to use the bathroom, but that's just because I'm getting older, I think."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, my periods had been pretty light and irregular for a while before this started. I'd have a period, and then nothing for months, and then another period. It was never very heavy, but it was always unpredictable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've made a note of the changes in your menstrual cycle. Have you ever been diagnosed with any endometrial or ovarian conditions, or had any surgeries related to your reproductive organs?"

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I've never had any issues like that. I had a routine Pap smear a few years ago, and everything came back normal."

  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I've never used hormone replacement therapy or birth control pills. I've just dealt with my periods as they came, but like I said, they were pretty light and irregular anyway."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "How would you describe the bleeding you're experiencing, is it light spotting or more heavy flow?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's a mix of both, to be honest. Sometimes it's just a few drops here and there, and other times it's a bit more substantial, but not enough to soak through a pad."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "The bleeding is mostly light spotting, but there have been a few heavier periods. Can you tell me, have you noticed any lumps or swelling in your abdomen that you can feel?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's hard to describe, but it's more like a feeling of fullness, like my stomach is swollen. I've been feeling it for a few weeks now, and it seems to get worse after I eat."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "The lump is a bit hard to the touch, but not rock hard. It's more like it's tender to the touch."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've been feeling a bit more tender in that area, especially if I press on it. It's not painful, but it's just a bit uncomfortable."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, yes, I have felt a bit of pressure in my pelvis, especially when I'm standing for a long time or walking. It's like a nagging feeling that's hard to ignore."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your difficulty moving your bowels. Can you tell me if you've ever had any family history of ovarian or endometrial cancer, or any other type of cancer?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I do have a sister who had ovarian cancer, but it was a few years ago, and she's doing okay now. She had surgery and treatment, and she's been in remission for a while."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't think I've noticed any unusual changes in my vaginal discharge or odor. It's just been the usual discharge, and I don't really pay much attention to it unless it's heavier than usual, which it has been with the bleeding."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see. Have you had any recent changes in your mood or energy levels, such as feeling more tired than usual or having trouble sleeping?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, I have been feeling more tired than usual, and it's not just because I'm getting older. I have trouble sleeping at night, and even when I do fall asleep, I wake up feeling exhausted. Sometimes I just feel like I'm running on empty, and I don't know how to refill my tank."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It seems to be fixed in one place, but when I press around it, I can feel it move a bit. It's not like it's sliding around, but it does seem to shift when I apply pressure."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "With that final piece of information, I'm going to take a closer look at the lump. *examines the lump* \n\nIt seems to be located in your lower abdomen, near the ovary area. I'm going to perform a pelvic exam to get a better sense of the lump's size and location. *performs a pelvic exam*\n\nNow, I'm going to request some test results to help me narrow down the diagnosis. REQUEST TEST: CA-125, Ultrasound of the abdomen, and a biopsy of the adnexal mass."
