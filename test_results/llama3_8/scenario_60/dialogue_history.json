  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It started about 2 weeks ago, after I had eaten a meal. It wasn't constant, but it comes and goes, usually after I eat something."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "It started about 6 months ago, and at first, it was pretty constant, but lately, it's been more occasional."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been more frequent lately, and I've noticed it's worse when I wear certain types of earrings, like the ones that are too tight or have sharp edges."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Do you remember if the pain is worse when you're eating, talking, or moving your jaw in any way?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, it's worse when I'm eating, especially when I'm chewing or swallowing. The pain can be quite sharp, and it's usually temporary, but it can be uncomfortable."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Does the pain radiate to any other areas, such as your face or temple, or is it strictly confined to your ear?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, the pain is strictly in my ear, but it can feel like it's spreading through my earlobe sometimes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "It's been 6 months since the pain started, and you mentioned it's been more occasional lately. Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your hearing or if you're experiencing any ringing or fullness in your ears?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, my hearing has actually improved a bit since my surgery 12 weeks ago. The audiologist said I had a 20-decibel improvement in my hearing, but sometimes I still feel like I'm missing certain sounds, especially when there's background noise."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'd like to examine your ear more closely. Can you show me your earring, the one you mentioned you have trouble wearing after your tympanoplasty?"

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see that you have some trouble putting the earring in, can you tell me if it's painful to do so, or if it's more of a feeling of pressure or discomfort?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's definitely painful when I put it in, especially if I push it in too far. It's like a pinch, but it's not unbearable."

    "text": "Can you tell me if the pain you experience with the earring is similar to the shooting ear pain you described earlier?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "The earring pain is actually quite different from the shooting pain I experience. The earring pain is more of a dull ache and it's usually worse when I try to put it in, but it's not as intense as the shooting pain."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I have to admit, I've been feeling really stressed out lately. My job as a cashier at the department store can be overwhelming, especially during peak hours. I've been trying to manage it with deep breathing exercises, but it's been a challenge."

  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You've had trouble wearing earrings after your tympanoplasty, which makes me think about the surgery itself. Did your surgeon mention anything about potential complications or risks related to the surgery?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, my surgeon didn't mention anything about potential complications or risks. They just told me it was a routine surgery and I would be back to normal in a few weeks."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see that the earring pain is distinct from the shooting pain. Can you tell me if you've noticed any discharge or odor coming from your ear since the surgery?"

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I still feel like I'm standing on solid ground, but sometimes when I'm at work and it's really busy, I feel a bit dizzy, but I think that's just from being overwhelmed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've been thinking a lot about the fact that a doctor with similar symptoms to yours was diagnosed with cancer. Can you tell me if you've had any unusual or unexplained weight loss recently?"
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've asked all my questions, now it's time to think about your diagnosis. I'm concerned about the possibility of complications from the tympanoplasty surgery, but I'm also aware of the doctor with similar symptoms who was diagnosed with cancer.
