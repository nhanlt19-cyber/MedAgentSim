    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I was born a few days ago, and I've been having some trouble since then. My mom says I'm a little different, but she hasn't really been able to take care of me because she didn't go to any doctor visits during her pregnancy."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't really feel like eating that much. When I do eat, I get really tired afterwards."

    "speaker": "Patient",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. But I do have some things on my skin that don't look quite right. They're kind of blue and they don't go away when you press on them."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your responses, but I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about your symptoms. Can you tell me if you've had any episodes of blue discoloration around your mouth, nose, or skin since birth?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",

  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't really make any sounds when I breathe, but sometimes it feels like I'm making a really high-pitched noise, like a squeaky toy. It's really quiet, though, so you might not be able to hear it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You've been having trouble breathing and making high-pitched sounds while breathing, that's concerning. Have you been experiencing any pauses in breathing or episodes of not breathing at all?"

    "text": "No, I don't think so. I just get this really loud, high-pitched noise when I try to breathe, and it's really hard to catch my breath."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed that you're having trouble breathing and have been experiencing grunting episodes. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any episodes of apnea, or pauses in breathing, while you're sleeping?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, I do get those pauses when I'm sleeping, and it's really scary. It feels like my whole body just freezes up and I can't breathe."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your apnea episodes while sleeping, that's crucial information. Have you been experiencing any episodes of fever or increased temperature since birth?"

  },

    "text": "No, I don't think so. But sometimes when I try to move my eyes, it feels like they're stuck or something, and it's really hard to get them to move."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't think so, my mom says she hasn't been around anyone who's sick. But sometimes when I try to hear things, it feels like I'm not really listening to them, like I'm not really hearing anything."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, I think I have been making some strange noises when you listen to my heart. It's kind of a constant sound, like a whisper, and it doesn't seem to change when I move around or breathe."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of the unusual sounds I heard when I listened to your heart. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any swelling in your abdomen or any unusual fullness in your tummy?"
