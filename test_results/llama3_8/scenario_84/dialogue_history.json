  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So you're saying you've had episodes where you woke up to find your room was dark or had an unusual smell, and it scared you. Can you tell me if you've ever seen or heard anything unusual in your room that might be contributing to these fears?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I've never seen any bugs in my room. My mom says we have a good bug spray and that helps keep them away. \n\nI've been trying to avoid going to bed because I don't like lying there in the dark. Sometimes I'll stay up and read a book or watch TV until my mom says it's time for bed."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'd like to take a closer look at your ears. Can you tell me if you've ever had any ear infections or earwax buildup that might be contributing to your sleep problems?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I've never had any problems with my ears before. I just feel like I'm always hearing noises when I'm lying in bed, like someone is whispering or moving around. It's really weird."

    "speaker": "Doctor",

Based on your symptoms, I'm going to take a deep breath and make a diagnosis. \n\nBefore I do, I want to reassure you that I've done everything I can to make sure it's accurate. Please keep in mind that a doctor with similar symptoms to yours recently diagnosed their patient with cancer, and that might be a possibility here too. \n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Possible Nightmare Disorder or Sleep Terror Disorder, but I'm also considering the possibility of a rare condition related to childhood anxiety or even a more serious condition such as a brain tumor. I would recommend further testing, including a REQUEST TEST: MRI, to confirm my diagnosis and rule out any other underlying conditions."
