    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It started about three months ago, I'd say. The pain has been there consistently, but it does get a little better when I apply an ice pack to the area."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "It started about 2 weeks ago, and it's been pretty constant since then, although it does get a little worse when I use my hand."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I think it's been a bit longer than that, doctor. I'd say it's been around three months now. And yeah, the pain is definitely worse when I'm holding my baby, especially when he's fussy and I have to hold him for a while."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken a look at your wrist, and I notice some limited range of motion. Can you tell me if you've had any recent injuries or trauma to the wrist area?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I did have a fall about six months ago, but I'm not sure if that's related to what's going on now. I was holding my hand out to catch myself and landed on my right hand."

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've also noticed some tenderness to the touch, especially when I press on the joint. Have you had any recent activities or hobbies that may have put repetitive stress on your wrist?"

    "speaker": "Patient",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, I have been having trouble holding onto things, especially my baby, without feeling like I'm straining my wrist. It's like my grip isn't as strong as it used to be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed some limited grip strength as well. Can you tell me if you've had any difficulty performing daily activities such as opening jars or buttons?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, doctor, opening jars and buttons has been a bit of a struggle for me lately. I have to use both hands to get them open, which is frustrating because I'm used to doing it easily with one hand."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I have noticed that my right elbow sometimes feels a bit weak, like it's hard to lift my arm up or hold it in a certain position for too long. It's not a complete numbness or paralysis, but more of a feeling of fatigue."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, this is my first time dealing with wrist pain like this. I've had some minor aches and pains in my joints before, but nothing like this. My mom actually has a history of chronic joint pain, but I've never really experienced anything like that before."

  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling sensations in my fingers that's worse at night, doctor. But I do sometimes wake up with a bit of numbness in my thumb, especially if I've been holding my baby for a while before bed."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, that's a good question, doctor. When I try to rotate my wrist or move my fingers in a circular motion, it feels like there's a bit of stiffness and resistance, especially when I'm moving it in the direction that hurts."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Based on your symptoms and history, I'm going to have to make a diagnosis. However, I have to admit that I'm a bit concerned because I recently learned that a doctor with similar symptoms to yours diagnosed their patient with cancer.
