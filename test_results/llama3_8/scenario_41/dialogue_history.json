    "text": "Yes, I've had some pain in my left side, but it's not always there. Sometimes it feels like a dull ache, and other times it's more of a sharp pain. It's hard to explain, but it's like my body is just... holding onto something."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's hard to describe, but it's more of a dull ache, I think. It's like my body is just... tight, you know? And sometimes it feels like it's radiating or something, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly where it is."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I don't smoke or drink at all. I've actually been trying to eat healthier and exercise more since we started trying to conceive, but it's been a bit of a challenge. I've been feeling really overwhelmed with everything going on, and it's hard to stick to a routine when I'm feeling anxious all the time."

    "text": "I've taken note of your irregular periods, the tenderness on the left side, and the negative pregnancy test result. Based on the information you've provided, I'm going to take a guess that you may be experiencing endometriosis. This condition can cause pelvic pain, irregular periods, and difficulty conceiving. It's also possible that you may have a condition called adenomyosis, which is similar to endometriosis but occurs when tissue from the uterine lining grows into the uterine muscle.\n\nHowever, I want to consider other possibilities, such as a ovarian cyst or a uterine fibroid. I'd like to request some additional test results to help me narrow down the diagnosis. REQUEST TEST: Transvaginal Ultrasound."
