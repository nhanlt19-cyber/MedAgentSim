    "speaker": "Patient",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "They've been pretty constant, to be honest. I mean, there are some days where I feel like I'm doing okay, but most days it's like my body's just constantly pushing things out, if that makes sense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "They've been persistent for about 6 weeks now. The diarrhea is mostly after I eat, especially after consuming dairy products."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's like my stomach's always racing, and I feel like I have to go right away. Sometimes I get this cramping feeling in my lower abdomen, but it's weird because it actually feels a little better after I've, ah, relieved myself."

    "text": "Have you experienced any weight loss or fever along with these symptoms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I've been a bit concerned about my weight lately, I've been feeling like I'm eating a lot but not really feeling full, if that makes sense. And as for fever, I don't think so, but I do get a bit of a chill sometimes after I've had a bowel movement."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of that. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or mucus in it?"

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "No, I haven't noticed any blood in my stool, but I have seen a bit of mucus in it, mostly after eating."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've always been pretty healthy, so I don't think I have any underlying conditions like that. I mean, I've never had any issues like this before, so it's been a bit of a mystery to me."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you noticed any triggers that make your symptoms worse, such as stress or certain foods?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "You know, I think I've noticed that if I eat something high in sugar or fried foods, it tends to make my symptoms worse. And like I said, dairy products seem to be a problem too."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Do you have any family history of gastrointestinal issues or cancer, which could be a concern given the recent news about another doctor's diagnosis?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",

  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, it feels a bit sore when you press on it, but it's not like it's throbbing or anything. I mean, it's more of a dull ache, I guess."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of the mucus in your stool and the triggers you've mentioned, such as dairy products. Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your bowel movements, such as urgency or difficulty controlling them?"

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, it's like my body's just constantly racing to get everything out as quickly as possible. I feel like I'm always on the verge of having to go, and sometimes I'll be in the middle of something and I'll just have to drop everything and run to the bathroom. It's pretty frustrating, to be honest."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've always been pretty regular, but I do remember having some issues with constipation when I was younger. But that was a long time ago, and it never really persisted for too long."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your family history and the recent news about the other doctor's diagnosis. Have you ever had any abdominal surgeries or procedures that might be related to your current symptoms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I've had a few routine check-ups and vaccinations, but nothing that I can remember that would be related to my stomach or intestines."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'd like to request a physical examination of your lower abdomen to check for any signs of tenderness or masses. Can you tell me more about the mucus you've noticed in your stool, is it a thick, jelly-like substance or more of a loose, watery consistency?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's kind of... stringy, I guess. It's not like a solid piece, but it's not just water either. It's more like a thin, gooey substance that's just sort of... there."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You mentioned the mucus in your stool is a loose, watery consistency. Can you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms such as bloating or gas after eating?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, actually, I have noticed that sometimes after I eat, especially after consuming dairy products, I feel really bloated and uncomfortable. It's like my stomach's just swollen and tight, and I feel like I need to pass gas or something."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any symptoms of fatigue or weakness, as some gastrointestinal issues can lead to malabsorption of essential nutrients?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, I've been feeling pretty fatigued lately. I mean, it's not like I'm exhausted all the time, but I do get these moments where I just feel really drained and need to take a nap. And sometimes I feel like my muscles are weak, like I'm just not as strong as I used to be."
  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, my appetite has been a bit off lately. I've been eating more frequently, but I don't really feel like I'm getting full. It's like my stomach's always empty, even after I've eaten a big meal. And as for swallowing, I don't think so, but I have noticed that sometimes I'll feel like food is just sitting there in my stomach for a long time, not really digesting properly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your physical examination and the consistency of the mucus in your stool. Have you noticed any recent changes in your stool's color or shape, such as it being darker or more narrow?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, it's usually just a normal brown color, but occasionally it can be a bit lighter, like it's not quite fully digested or something. And as for the shape, I've noticed that it's often kind of... loose, like it's not really formed into a solid shape."
