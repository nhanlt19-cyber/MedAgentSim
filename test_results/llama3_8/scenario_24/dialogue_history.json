    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Over the past few months, I've noticed that my breathing gets a bit harder when I'm doing simple tasks, and my stomach has been getting bigger. The ovarian mass, I've had it for as long as I can remember, but it's been getting bigger too."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been really hard to keep up with my teaching schedule, I have to stop to catch my breath even after just walking from one classroom to the next. And I've noticed that my clothes are getting tighter around the middle, but I just thought it was from eating too much."
