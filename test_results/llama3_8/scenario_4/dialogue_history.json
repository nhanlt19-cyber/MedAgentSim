    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, my sinusitis symptoms were manageable, I just had a pretty bad headache and some nasal congestion, but they were under control with the amoxicillin at first. I didn't think much of it, just assumed it was a normal sinus infection."

    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You mentioned you were treated with antibiotics for acute sinusitis, but I have to say, the combination of fatigue, flank pain, and fever doesn't seem quite right for a typical sinusitis case.
