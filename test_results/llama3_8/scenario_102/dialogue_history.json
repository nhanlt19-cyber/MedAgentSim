    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Patient",

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't think I've noticed any tick bites, doc. But I do remember my mom saying that I got a tick bite a few years ago when I was playing in the park. It was a small tick, and it was removed right away, so I don't think it's a big deal."

    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Doc, I don't think so. My heartbeat feels normal to me, and I don't feel like I'm breathing any differently than usual. But my mom says I've been breathing a bit more heavily when I'm running around or playing outside."
