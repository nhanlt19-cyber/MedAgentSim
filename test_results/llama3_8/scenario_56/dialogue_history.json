  },

  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I mean, I might get really mad and stomp my foot, but I don't usually hit anyone."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, sometimes I have trouble falling asleep at night because I keep thinking about things I don't want to do the next day. Like, I'll be lying in bed and I'll think about how I don't want to go to school tomorrow and do all that stuff."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I remember one time, my mom was trying to get me to do my homework, but I didn't want to. She said I had to focus and I just got really mad. I started yelling and stomping my feet. My sister was playing with blocks nearby and I knocked them over on purpose. My mom said I was being really mean and I didn't want to be mean, but I just felt so angry."
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, sometimes I get really mad when I'm playing a game and I don't get to be the one to pick the teams. It feels like it's not fair and I just want to walk away. But if I'm playing with my friends in the park, like tag or soccer, I'm okay with it. I actually really like playing with them."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, sometimes I feel like that. Like, I'm sitting in class and I'm waiting for the teacher to say something that will make me mad, so I can just get up and leave. It's like I'm always waiting for something to happen, and it's hard to relax when I'm feeling like that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your description of feeling \"on edge\" or \"walking on eggshells.\" Can you tell me if you've ever had any trouble making friends or feeling like you're fitting in with your peers?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I do have friends at school, and they like playing with me. But sometimes when I'm trying to play with them, I get really frustrated if we can't do what I want to do. Like, if we're playing a game and I want to be the boss, but my friends don't want me to be."
  },

    "text": "It sounds like you have a pretty good idea of what triggers those episodes for you. Can you tell me more about how you typically cope with those feelings when they arise?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I usually try to walk away from the situation, like I do when I'm playing a game and I don't get to pick the teams. Sometimes I'll just start doing something else, like drawing or playing with blocks, to calm down. But it's hard to explain, it's like my brain just feels really mixed up and I don't know how to make it feel better."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "That's helpful to know, but I have to ask, have you ever experienced any seizures or episodes where you lost consciousness due to feeling overwhelmed?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I've never blacked out or anything like that. But sometimes when I'm really mad or frustrated, I feel like my body is shaking or trembling. It's hard to control myself when I'm feeling that way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You mentioned that you sometimes feel overwhelmed and don't know how to calm down - have you ever been taught any relaxation techniques or strategies to manage those feelings?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't really know any special techniques, but I do like to run around and play outside when I'm feeling really mad or frustrated. It seems to help me feel a little better. \n\nIs that okay? Can I go outside and play now?"

    "text": "Yeah, my mom gets really stressed out sometimes when she's working or dealing with stuff at home. She gets a little short with me and my sister, but it's not mean or anything. She just seems really tired and overwhelmed. My sister can be really annoying sometimes, but she's still my sister, and I try to be nice to her."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

I have to admit, I'm a bit concerned about the possibility of a neurological disorder, given some of the symptoms you've described. I'm going to take a moment to review our conversation and see if I can make a diagnosis. \n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Autism Spectrum Disorder"
