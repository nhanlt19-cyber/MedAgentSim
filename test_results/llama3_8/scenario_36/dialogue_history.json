    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "It's been 2 months now, and to be honest, it's been pretty constant. There have been a few times when it felt a bit better for a day or two, but it always comes back."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Those episodes where it felt better, they were pretty short-lived, maybe a day or two, and then the pain would come back, sometimes even worse than before. It's like it's trying to tell me something, but I'm not sure what."

    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's pretty stiff when I first get up, but once I start moving around, it loosens up a bit. I can move it, but it's not as smooth as it used to be. Sometimes I feel like I'm walking on eggshells because of it."
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've tried taking ibuprofen a few times, but it didn't really seem to make a difference. The pain was still there, and the swelling didn't go down at all. I was hoping it would help, but it didn't do much for me."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, it's usually worse at the end of the day, especially after I've been on my feet for a long time. It feels like the pain just builds up over the course of the day, and by the evening, it's pretty intense."

    "text": "The pain is definitely worse on the inside of my knee, near the center. It feels like it's concentrated in that area, and the swelling is more noticeable on that side too."

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've had a few instances where it feels like my knee is going to give way, especially when I'm standing up from a seated position. It's a bit unsettling, to be honest, because I'm not sure what's happening."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been a bit more cautious about how I walk lately. I don't want to put too much stress on my knee, so I've been trying to avoid putting my full weight on it when I'm walking. It's not that I've noticed a significant change in my gait or balance, but I'm just being more careful, I guess."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'd like to perform a physical examination of your knee to get a better understanding of the pain and swelling. Can you please stand up and lift your left leg straight out to the side, so I can assess the range of motion and any potential weakness in your knee?"

    "speaker": "Patient",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, that's a good question. When I squat down, I do feel a bit of pain, especially in the inside of my knee. And yeah, it does get worse when I try to straighten it out again. It's like my knee is protesting, you know?"
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Based on your symptoms and physical examination, I have to say that I'm concerned about the possibility of a serious underlying condition. I've heard of a doctor with similar symptoms to yours who was later diagnosed with cancer.
