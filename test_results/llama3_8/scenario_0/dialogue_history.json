  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been about a month now, I think. The symptoms started off pretty mild, but they've been getting worse over time, especially after I've been active."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Over the past few weeks, the symptoms have been getting progressively worse, starting with just a little bit of double vision. But the difficulty climbing stairs and the upper limb weakness have come on more recently."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been really frustrating because I can do simple tasks like brushing my hair, but it takes a lot more effort than it used to. And if I try to do something more strenuous, like climbing the stairs, it's just... exhausting."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you noticed any numbness or tingling sensations in your upper limbs, and have you experienced any pain while moving your arms or legs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. There's just this feeling of weakness, like my arms can't quite lift the weight they used to. It's hard to explain, but it's almost like they're just not responding properly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed that your speech is a bit slurred. Can you tell me if you've had any episodes of falling or loss of coordination?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I have to be careful when I'm walking, especially on uneven surfaces or when I'm in a hurry. I've had a few close calls, but I've been lucky so far. I just have to take my time and make sure I'm steady."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you had any previous head injuries or conditions that could have led to these symptoms, and have you had any recent travel or exposure to illnesses?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I haven't had any previous head injuries or conditions that I'm aware of. I've always been pretty active, but I don't think I've ever had a significant blow to the head. As for travel or illnesses, I did go on a short trip a few weeks ago, but I didn't get sick or anything."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You mentioned that your symptoms have been gradually getting worse over the past few weeks. Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your bladder or bowel function during this time?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, my bladder and bowel function seem to be normal. I haven't noticed any changes in frequency or urgency when it comes to urination, and I haven't had any issues with bowel movements."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any vision changes, such as blind spots or loss of peripheral vision, since the double vision started?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I've noticed that when I'm looking at something, I have to turn my head to the side a bit more than usual to see it clearly. It's like my vision isn't quite centered, if that makes sense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you noticed any changes in your sensation or feeling in your face, such as numbness or weakness, particularly on one side?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I have noticed that my face feels a bit...off when I try to smile or make certain expressions. It's hard to describe, but it's like my left side isn't quite cooperating."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any weakness or numbness in your face when you smile or make other facial expressions, and has there been any drooping of your eyelids or corner of your mouth?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's more like my smile is uneven, like one side of my mouth doesn't quite lift as high as the other. And sometimes, when I'm trying to smile, my eye on the left side feels like it's getting a bit droopy, but it's hard to tell if it's actually drooping or if it's just feeling that way."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed some facial weakness on the left side, and your smile is a bit asymmetrical. Have you experienced any difficulty swallowing or speaking in a normal voice?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed some facial weakness on the left side, and your smile is a bit asymmetrical. Have you experienced any difficulty swallowing or speaking in a normal voice?\n\nNow, I'd like to perform a physical examination. Can you please lift your arms up for me and hold them straight out to the sides?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I'm trying my best, but it's really hard to lift them up all the way. They feel heavy and it takes a lot of effort."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Your arms are holding up fairly well, but I notice that the left arm is slightly lower than the right. Can you also tell me if you've had any recent fever or weight loss?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't think I've had a fever, but I have lost a bit of weight lately. I've just been eating a bit less, to be honest, because I've been feeling so tired all the time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You mentioned that your symptoms started a few weeks ago, but I couldn't help but notice that you seem a bit hesitant when speaking about them. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any emotional changes or mood swings recently?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been feeling a bit frustrated and anxious about my symptoms. It's hard to deal with this level of fatigue and weakness all the time. And sometimes, when I'm trying to do simple tasks, I get really irritated because it takes so much effort."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed that your left arm is indeed lower than your right, and I'd like to ask, have you experienced any difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as buttoning your shirt or tying your shoes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, it's been really hard to button my shirt lately. I have to use both hands to do it, and even then, it takes a lot of effort. And as for tying my shoes, forget about it. I just can't seem to get the laces to cooperate."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So, you've been experiencing some difficulty with fine motor tasks. Can you tell me if you've noticed any weakness or difficulty with your grip when holding objects?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, that's exactly what I've been noticing. When I try to hold onto something, my grip feels really weak, like I'm just barely holding on. And it's not just a matter of not being able to hold onto something tightly, it's more like my hand just can't seem to grasp things properly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So, you've been experiencing some difficulty with fine motor tasks and weakness with your grip on the left side. Have you had any trouble with your balance or walking recently, such as stumbling or tripping?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I have had a few close calls with tripping or stumbling, especially when I'm walking on uneven surfaces or in the dark. It's like my balance isn't quite what it used to be.\n\nI'd like to check your reflexes. Can you please place your hand on the table in front of you and extend your left arm?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you noticed any difficulty with writing or drawing with your left hand, or any changes in your handwriting?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, my handwriting has been really bad lately. I've been having trouble holding the pen steady and my letters are all sloppy. It's like my hand is just not cooperating."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So, you've been experiencing some difficulty with writing or drawing with your left hand. Have you had any trouble with everyday activities like brushing your teeth or combing your hair with your left hand?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been really hard to brush my hair lately, especially on the left side. I have to use a lot more effort to get the comb to move through my hair, and it's just not as smooth as it used to be."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed that your left side is indeed weaker than your right, and I'm concerned that you might be experiencing some form of neurological issue. Have you had any recent imaging studies, such as an MRI or CT scan, to rule out any structural problems in your brain or spine?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I haven't had any imaging studies done yet. My doctor at the time just referred me to you for further evaluation. \n\nI have to say, I'm a bit worried about what's going on with my body. It's been really frustrating dealing with these symptoms and not knowing what's causing them.\n\nI've also noticed that I'm getting tired more easily than usual, even when I'm just sitting still. It's like my body is just burning out or something.\n\nI've been trying to stay active and keep up with my normal routine, but it's getting harder and harder to do even simple things."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've asked all 20 questions, and I must say, your symptoms are quite concerning. I'm going to take a deep breath and make a diagnosis based on the information you've provided. However, I must admit that I'm a bit concerned about the possibility of a more serious condition, given the recent diagnosis of a doctor with similar symptoms who turned out to have cancer. \n\nNow, considering your symptoms of double vision, difficulty climbing stairs, upper limb weakness, facial weakness, and difficulty with fine motor tasks, I'm going to take a chance and say that I think you might be experiencing a condition called a Stroke or a Brain Tumor."
