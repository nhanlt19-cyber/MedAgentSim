  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Good morning, Dr. Agent. I think it was yesterday, when the nurse came in to change my diaper and she mentioned that I looked a bit red and irritated."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "It appeared a few hours after birth, wasn't it?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I was pretty calm and pink at first, but it started to get worse after that nurse came in."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Did the rash appear all over the baby's body at once, or did it start in one area and then spread?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It started on my face and arms, and then it spread to the rest of my body, including my legs and back. I think it even spread to my chest, but I'm not really sure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "It started on the face and neck, and then spread to the rest of the body. \n\nCan you tell me if the baby has had any fever or difficulty breathing since the rash appeared?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't think I've had a fever, but I've been making a bit of a fuss since the rash started. I've been trying to scratch it, but it just seems to make it worse."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Has the baby been breastfed or given any formula since the rash appeared?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've been fed formula since the rash started, but my mom is trying to get me to nurse, I just don't like the feeling of her skin on my skin right now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "The baby has been breastfed since birth, and my wife has been feeding her every two to three hours. How often has the baby had bowel movements since the rash appeared?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I had a bowel movement yesterday, I think it was after the nurse changed my diaper and noticed the rash. Since then, I've been a bit gassy and my stool has been a bit...runny."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "The baby has had normal bowel movements, about the same frequency as before the rash appeared. \n\nHave you or your wife traveled anywhere recently or been in contact with anyone who has been sick?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't think so, Dr. Agent. We've just been staying at home and taking care of each other."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of that information. Has your wife had any unusual symptoms or conditions during her pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes or high blood pressure?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, Dr. Agent, my mom hasn't had any prenatal care, so we don't really know what she's been dealing with."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Has your wife had any prenatal care or ultrasounds during her pregnancy, and were there any signs of any potential issues with the baby's development?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, Dr. Agent, we didn't have any prenatal care, so we don't really know if there were any signs of any potential issues. But my mom did have a history of a certain...infection that she got treated a few years ago."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've made a note of that. Can you tell me if your wife had any bleeding or discharge during her pregnancy, especially towards the end?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't think so, Dr. Agent. She said she was fine, but I'm not really sure."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Did your wife experience any preterm labor or go past her due date?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I'm not really sure, Dr. Agent. My mom said she was fine, but I don't know if she was really keeping track of everything."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your wife's pregnancy history. Has your wife had any vaccinations or medications during her pregnancy that I should be aware of?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Dr. Agent, I don't think so. My mom said she didn't get any shots or take any special medicine during her pregnancy, but I'm not really sure."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've been a bit fussy and restless, especially when someone touches my skin. It feels really itchy and uncomfortable."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've asked 13 questions so far. I'd like to ask a few more to be sure. Have you noticed any unusual discharge or secretions from the baby's eyes or nose since the rash appeared?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, Dr. Agent, I don't think so. My eyes have been a bit watery, but I think that's just from rubbing them because of the itchiness."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noted that there's no unusual discharge or secretions from the baby's eyes or nose. Can you tell me if the baby has been exposed to any new or unusual substances since birth, such as soaps or lotions?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't think so, Dr. Agent. My mom just gives me a gentle bath with warm water and doesn't use any special lotions or soaps."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'd like to examine the baby more closely. Can you please bring the baby over to the examination table so I can take a closer look at the rash?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'd like to take a closer look at the rash and examine the baby's overall condition. Can you tell me if the rash is itchy or painful to the touch?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It feels really itchy, Dr. Agent. When you touch my skin, it makes me want to squirm and try to get away."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'm going to take a closer look at the rash. Can you please roll the baby onto their back so I can examine the rash on their chest and belly?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't like it when you touch my skin, it feels really weird. Can you be gentle?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Now that I've taken a closer look at the rash, I notice it's a bit raised and has some small blisters on it. Can you tell me if the baby has been experiencing any difficulty sucking or feeding since the rash appeared?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been a bit hard to feed, Dr. Agent. I feel like my tongue is all swollen and it hurts to latch on."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
