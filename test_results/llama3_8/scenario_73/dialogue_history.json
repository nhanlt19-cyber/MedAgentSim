    "text": "Honestly, my work's been a bit of a blur lately. I'm still showing up to the office, but I just don't feel like I'm contributing as much as I used to. And as for relationships, I've been getting a bit of weird looks from my coworkers, especially after some of the things I've said in meetings."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been having trouble remembering things, like what I was supposed to pick up from the store or where I put my keys. And sometimes, I'll be in the middle of a conversation and just...lose my train of thought. It's really frustrating."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've been eating a lot more than I used to. I mean, I've always enjoyed food, but now I feel like I'm constantly hungry. And there's just something about chocolate pudding...I don't know, it's like I need it all the time."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Sleep? Well, I'd say I'm sleeping a lot more than I used to. I mean, I can just curl up on the couch and pass out for hours, no problem. My family's always telling me I'm sleeping too much, but I just feel so...tired all the time."

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Well, to be honest, I just couldn't keep up with the routine anymore. Simple tasks at work started to feel overwhelming, and I'd often find myself zoning out in meetings. My family and coworkers were getting concerned, and I guess I just realized I needed some help."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I've been feeling a bit...sluggish, I suppose. My movements don't feel as smooth as they used to, and sometimes I trip over my own feet. I've also been having trouble standing up from a seated position, it feels like my legs just give out on me."
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I don't know, I just haven't been feeling like myself, I guess. I mean, I used to take pride in my appearance, but now I just don't care as much. I've been going a bit longer between showers and I've let my hair get a bit...unkempt, I suppose."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, my vision seems fine, but I've been having trouble reading lately. I mean, I'll be in the middle of a sentence and I'll lose my place, or I'll get confused about what I was reading. It's really frustrating.\n\nAnd, to be honest, I've been having trouble recognizing faces, especially if I haven't seen someone in a while. I'll see a coworker or a friend, and I'll just...not know who they are for a second. It's embarrassing."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've just felt really...apathetic, I guess. I don't get that guilty or anxious feeling about anything, even when I think about the things I've said or done. It's like I'm just observing myself from outside my body, and I don't really care about the consequences."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I've been having trouble getting dressed in the morning. I'll put on a shirt, but then I'll forget to put on pants, or I'll just leave the house with a shirt on and nothing else. It's not that I'm forgetful, it's just...I don't know, it feels like I'm just going through the motions.\n\nAnd managing my finances? Yeah, I've been having trouble with that too. I'll get a bill in the mail and I'll just...forget to pay it, or I'll pay it twice. It's really frustrating, but I just feel like I'm not really in control of my life right now."

    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been feeling a bit self-conscious about my appearance lately. I've been gaining weight, and my skin doesn't feel as...tight as it used to. I don't know, it just feels like everything is sagging a bit."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I don't know if I'd say paranoia, but I've been feeling like people are just trying to get to me or something. I'll be in a conversation and I'll just feel like they're judging me or trying to figure me out. It's hard to explain, but it's like I'm always on edge, waiting for something to happen.\n\nI've also been having trouble understanding sarcasm and idioms. I'll be talking to someone and they'll say something like \"break a leg\" and I'll just think they're literally telling me to break my leg. It's really frustrating because I feel like I'm missing out on these little nuances that everyone else seems to understand.\n\nAnd, to be honest, I've been having trouble recognizing emotions in others. I'll be in a conversation and someone will say they're feeling sad or upset, but I just won't be able to understand why. It's like I'm looking at them through a fog or something."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been having a bit of a metallic taste in my mouth lately. It's not always there, but when it is, it's pretty overpowering. And, I don't know if it's related, but I've been feeling like I need to drink a lot of water to get rid of it.\n\nAnd, yeah, I've noticed some unusual smells too. My clothes, my hair, even my skin...it all just seems to smell a bit...off, I guess. I've been trying to shower more often and use some strong deodorant, but it's just not making a difference.\n\nI'm starting to feel a bit...overwhelmed, I suppose. All these questions are making me feel like I'm just not making sense, and it's really frustrating. Can we just move on to something else?"

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I feel like I'm just getting my words jumbled up sometimes. I'll be trying to explain something, and it'll just come out all wrong. It's really frustrating because I feel like I'm trying to say something important, but it's just not coming out right."
  },

And when I do try to talk to them, I just feel like I'm not making sense. It's really frustrating because I know I used to be able to connect with them on a deeper level."

  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I feel like I'm just doing things without thinking them through. Like, I'll be out in public and I'll just...initiate conversations with strangers. I know it's not normal, but I just feel like I'm trying to connect with people, even if it doesn't make sense.\n\nAnd, yeah, I've been having trouble with impulse control. I'll see something, like a snack or a toy, and I'll just...buy it. Even if I don't need it or can't afford it. It's like my brain just tells me to get it, and I don't think twice about it.\n\nI'm starting to feel a bit anxious, to be honest. All these questions are making me feel like I'm just not making sense, and it's really frustrating. Can we just focus on finding a solution, rather than dwelling on the problems?"
