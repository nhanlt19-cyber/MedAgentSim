I have to admit, the symptoms you've presented do share some similarities with the doctor who diagnosed cancer in their patient. However, I'm going to have to rely on my own assessment. Based on your weight loss, difficulty breathing, liver enlargement, pitting edema, and other symptoms, I'm concerned that you may have a condition known as Liver Cirrhosis, possibly due to a parasite infection such as schistosomiasis given your travel history. \n\nHowever, I'm also concerned that your symptoms could be indicative of a more serious condition such as liver cancer or even a tumor in the liver. I'm going to have to order some tests to confirm my suspicions. \n\nREQUEST TEST: Liver Biopsy \nREQUEST TEST: Complete Blood Count (CBC) \nREQUEST TEST: Liver Function Tests (LFTs)"
