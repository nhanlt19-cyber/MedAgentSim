  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "It started about 6 months ago, I would say. I've been feeling really tired all the time, and it's getting harder to focus on my work and daily activities."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, it's like trying to remember things is taking a lot more effort than it used to. I'll be in the middle of a conversation and suddenly forget what I was saying."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've been having some trouble sleeping lately, but not necessarily because I'm wide awake. It's more like I just feel really exhausted and I don't have the energy to stay awake for long periods of time. I'll be lying in bed and suddenly I'm out cold."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been noticing that things seem a bit blurry to me, especially when I'm reading or watching TV. It's like my eyes are tired, but I'm not sure if it's just my imagination."
