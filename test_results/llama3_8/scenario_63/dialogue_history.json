  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "They're always critical, never calm or reassuring. It's like they're constantly yelling at me, telling me I'm a failure and that I'll never be good enough. It's hard to ignore them, even when I try to focus on something else."

    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Patient",

But I have been feeling really empty inside, like there's just a huge void that nothing can fill. It's hard to explain, but it's just this constant feeling of sadness and hopelessness that's been following me around."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, I've definitely noticed that I'm not retaining information as well as I used to. It's like I'll read something or have a conversation, and then 10 minutes later, I'll forget what we were talking about. It's really frustrating, because I feel like I'm just not as sharp as I used to be."

    "text": "Yes, I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life, but I'm not really present. I'll be sitting in a room with my boyfriend, but I'll feel like I'm in a different world, like I'm observing everything from outside my body. It's hard to explain, but it's like I'm disconnected from everything and everyone."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been avoiding most foods, but if I'm being completely honest, I've been craving sweets a lot lately. It's like I'm searching for something to fill this empty feeling inside, and sweets just seem to provide a temporary escape.

I've been going days without showering, and I've been wearing the same clothes over and over again because it just feels like too much effort to get dressed in something else. My boyfriend's been trying to get me to take care of myself, but it's hard when everything feels so overwhelming."
