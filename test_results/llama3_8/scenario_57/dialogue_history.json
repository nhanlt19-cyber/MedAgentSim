I've been thinking about the recent case I learned about, where a doctor diagnosed a patient with cancer based on similar symptoms, but it turned out to be something else entirely.\n\nGiven your recent travel history and exposure to people who might be sick, I'm also considering the possibility of a viral infection that affects the liver. But based on your symptoms and family history, I'm leaning towards a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Hepatoc"
