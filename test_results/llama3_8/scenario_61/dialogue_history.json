And sometimes I feel like I'm choking.\n\nYou've been experiencing some episodes of stridor, which is a high-pitched sound when you breathe in. Can you tell me if you've ever had any trouble breathing when you're lying on your back or in a certain position?\n\nWhen I'm on my back, it feels like I'm having trouble breathing.

You've had recurrent episodes of stridor and wheezing, especially during activities like eating, laughing, or crying. You've had trouble feeding and swallowing, and your weight gain has been poor since birth. Your tongue is restricted in its movement, and there's a slight indentation on the back of your throat. You've also had episodes of vomiting or spitting up food after eating, and your breathing can sound unusually loud or high-pitched during these episodes.\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Laryngotracheal bronchomalacia with associated feeding difficulties and aspiration."
