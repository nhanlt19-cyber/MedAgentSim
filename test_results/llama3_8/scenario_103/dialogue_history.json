My mom has to remind me to walk more normally.\n\nAnd, yeah, my gait is a bit weird now. I have to kind of swing my left leg out to the side when I'm walking so it doesn't hurt as much. It feels a little funny, but it's just what I've been doing for a while now."

Based on your symptoms of a limp and localized pain in your leg, without fever or acute distress, and considering your history of injuries and previous medical diagnoses, I'm going to take a careful approach.\n\nYou've mentioned that the pain and limp are located in the same area as your previous injuries, and you've experienced numbness and tingling sensations in the affected leg. These symptoms, combined with your history of injuries and previous medical diagnoses, make me suspect a possible issue with your growth plate.\n\nREQUEST TEST: X-RAY\n\nThis test will help me confirm my suspicions and determine the exact nature of your condition. I'll be back with the results after running the test."
