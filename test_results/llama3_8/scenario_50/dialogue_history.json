  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I'm 16, a high school student. I'm here because I haven't gotten my period yet and I'm a bit concerned about it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So, you're 16 years old, and you're here today because your parents are concerned about your delayed menarche, is that right?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, my mom said it's normal for girls to get their period around this age, but I've never had any bleeding or anything like that."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'd like to take a closer look at your physical appearance. Can you tell me about your family history, have you noticed any unusual physical features in yourself or your relatives that might be worth mentioning?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "My mom had some hair growth on her chin when she was pregnant with me, and I've always thought my clitoris was a bit... larger than usual, but I don't know if that's normal."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see you have a few interesting features, such as a short stature and a slightly webbed neck. Can you tell me if you've ever had any problems with your bones, like frequent fractures or a lot of back pain?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I've had a few pretty bad injuries over the years, and I've broken a few bones when I fell or got hit by something. Like, I broke my wrist when I fell off my bike, and my arm when I got hit by a ball."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your physical features and family history. Have you ever experienced any issues with your skin, such as cold intolerance or a lot of bruising?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I'm not sure if it's a webbed neck, I just feel like my neck is a bit... asymmetrical, I guess."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken a look at your webbed neck, and it does appear to be a bit more pronounced than usual. Have you ever had any issues with your thyroid gland, such as a goiter or difficulty swallowing?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. But I have noticed that my skin is really sensitive to the cold, and I get really cold even in mild temperatures."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed that you have a slight indentation in your palate, it looks like a small cleft. Can you tell me if you've ever had any dental issues or difficulties with eating due to a cleft palate?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've had some issues with my teeth, I've had to have a few of them removed because they were really crooked and overlapping. And eating can be a bit of a challenge sometimes, especially if I'm eating something crunchy or hard."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You've had a cleft palate, that's interesting. Have you had any surgery to correct it, or has it been managed conservatively?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've had a few surgeries to correct it, but I still have some issues with eating certain foods. And, to be honest, I've had some problems with my skin breaking out after those surgeries."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've made a note of the cleft palate, and I'd like to know more about your overall health. Have you ever experienced any issues with your growth and development, such as delayed puberty or short stature in comparison to your peers?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, I'm actually a lot shorter than most of the other girls in my class, and I've always been a bit concerned about it. And, to be honest, I've also had some issues with my skin getting really oily and breaking out in a lot of places."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You've been experiencing some issues with your growth and development, and you've also had a cleft palate that's been managed conservatively. I'd like to ask, have you ever had any problems with your menstrual cycle, other than the delayed menarche, such as irregular periods or heavy bleeding?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've never had any periods at all, so I don't really know what irregular or heavy bleeding would be like for me."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your issues with your menstrual cycle. Have you ever had any unusual bleeding or discharge, such as spotting between periods or after physical activity?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I've never really had any bleeding or discharge like that. But I do get a lot of pain in my lower abdomen, especially after I exercise or do something physically demanding. It's not always there, but when it is, it can be pretty intense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see that you've had some irregular bleeding and spotting, can you tell me if this is a new development or has it been a persistent issue throughout your life?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think it's been a persistent issue. I've always been a bit uncomfortable down there, but I never really associated it with bleeding or spotting until now."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So, the irregular bleeding and spotting have been a persistent issue throughout your life. That's helpful to know. Have you ever experienced any intellectual or cognitive difficulties, such as learning disabilities or difficulties in school?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I've never had any issues with learning or school. I'm actually a pretty good student and I've always done well in my classes."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You mentioned that you've had some irregular bleeding and spotting, and that it's been a persistent issue throughout your life. Can you tell me if you've ever experienced any pain or cramping associated with these bleeding episodes?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, I've had some pretty bad cramps with the pain, especially after I exercise or do something physically demanding. It's usually in my lower abdomen, and it can be really intense."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So, the irregular bleeding and spotting have been a persistent issue, and you've also experienced some pain or cramping associated with these bleeding episodes. Can you tell me if you've ever had any issues with your immune system, such as frequent infections or prolonged illnesses?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I've had a pretty good immune system, I don't get sick often and I recover quickly when I do get sick. But I have been on a lot of medications, including oral isotretinoin for my acne and an oral contraceptive, so I'm not sure if that affects my immune system at all."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your issues with your immune system, and I'd like to ask, have you ever been diagnosed with any autoimmune disorders or conditions that affect the immune system?"

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",

  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your family history, physical features, and health issues. Can you tell me if anyone in your family has been diagnosed with Turner syndrome or any other chromosomal abnormalities?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "My mom's side of the family has a history of some pretty rare medical conditions, but I'm not really sure what they are. My grandma had some kind of hormone imbalance that caused her to have some unusual physical features, but I don't know the specifics."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I see that you have a family history of Turner syndrome, which is a significant finding. Can you tell me if you've ever experienced any issues with your hearing or vision?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I've never had any problems with my hearing or vision, and I've never needed glasses or hearing aids. But I have had some issues with my balance and coordination, I've had a few falls and gotten hurt pretty easily."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "With that final question answered, I have enough information to make a diagnosis. However, I must admit that the fact that another doctor with similar symptoms to yours was diagnosed with cancer has left me with some concerns.\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Turner Syndrome"
