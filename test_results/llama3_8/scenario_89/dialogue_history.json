  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "About a year ago, I noticed my left hand was shaking a bit when I was holding things. It wasn't too bad at first, but lately, it's been getting worse."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "About 6 months ago, I started noticing that my hands would shake when I tried to hold a cup of coffee or when I was writing. And about 2 months ago, I started forgetting where I put things and had trouble remembering my schedule."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been pretty tough for me to hold onto things lately, like my coffee mug or my reading glasses. And yeah, I've been having trouble remembering things too, like what day it is or where I put my keys."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, it's been affecting my ability to take care of some things around the house. My wife has had to step in and help me with paying bills and keeping track of appointments."

  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "My mother had some... issues, I suppose you'd call them. She was diagnosed with something, but I'm not really sure what it was. She would sometimes get really withdrawn and wouldn't respond to things like she normally would."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "My speech has been a bit softer, to be honest. I find myself mumbling sometimes, and my wife has to ask me to repeat myself."

And to be honest, my appetite hasn't been great either. I've been eating less than I used to, and I've lost a bit of weight since I started noticing these symptoms."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So you haven't noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite, and you're not experiencing any difficulty with swallowing or eating. Can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your urinary habits or bowel movements since these symptoms started?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I've been going to the bathroom when I need to, and my bowel movements have been normal."

  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'm going to examine your hands more closely, that's helpful. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling sensations in your hands or fingers when your tremors occur?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. When my hand is shaking, I can still feel everything, it's just that my hand doesn't seem to be doing what I want it to."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'd like to take a closer look at your hands. They seem to be experiencing a resting tremor, which is often a sign of a neurological disorder. Have you ever been exposed to any toxins or heavy metals that could be contributing to your symptoms?"

    "speaker": "Patient",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You mentioned you haven't noticed any changes in your sleep patterns or appetite, but I still need to ask a few more questions to rule out other possibilities.

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been feeling a bit more subdued, like I'm not as engaged in things as I used to be. Sometimes I'll be talking to my wife, and I'll just... lose my train of thought, you know? I'll forget what I was saying or what we were discussing."
