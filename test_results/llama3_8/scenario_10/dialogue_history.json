Given the information you've provided and the recent diagnosis of a doctor with similar symptoms, I'm starting to lean towards a diagnosis of rectal cancer. \n\nHowever, I do want to consider other possibilities, such as a rectal polyp or an inflammatory condition. But with the irregular mass and your family history, I'm worried that cancer might be a strong possibility.\n\nBefore I make a final decision, I'd like to request one more test to help confirm my suspicions. REQUEST TEST: CT_Scan."
