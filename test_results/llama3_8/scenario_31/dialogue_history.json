Sometimes I'll go for a few days without having a bowel movement, and then I'll have one that's really loose. It's been a bit unpredictable, to be honest.\n\nI've been having trouble sleeping lately, doctor. I wake up in the middle of the night feeling short of breath and my heart is racing. It's really unsettling, to be honest.\n\nHave you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles, or any changes in your urine output?\n\nYes,"
