    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, doctor, I did have an X-ray done a few months ago, but the results didn't show anything out of the ordinary. The doctor at the time said I had some minor degenerative changes in my shoulder joint, but that it wasn't anything to worry about."

  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Based on your history of chronic left shoulder pain, limited range of motion, and stiffness, I'm concerned that we might be looking at a condition such as frozen shoulder or adhesive capsulitis. However, considering your pain has been getting worse over time, I'm also considering the possibility of a more serious condition."
