However, I must admit that I'm a bit concerned about the similarity in your symptoms to those of a patient I recently learned about who was diagnosed with melanoma. \n\nLet's review what we've discussed so far. You've had a growing lesion on your chest for about 2 months, which has changed color from light brown to darker brown with redness around it. The lesion is tender to the touch, and you've had some exposure to the sun recently. \n\nConsidering all of this information, I'm going to have to make a diagnosis based on the information provided."
