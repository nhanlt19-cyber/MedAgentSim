It's more of a dull ache, like my leg is just heavy and tired all the time.\n\nI've been taking some over-the-counter pain relievers and antibiotics to try and manage the wound, but I'm not sure if that's been helping or not. I've also been using some topical creams and ointments that my doctor recommended, but like I said, nothing seems to be working.\n\nTo be honest, I've been feeling pretty frustrated and defeated about the whole thing.
