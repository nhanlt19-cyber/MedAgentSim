    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It started about 4 weeks ago, I'd say. The fatigue has been pretty consistent, but some days are worse than others."

It's been going on for a few weeks now, and it's been getting worse. \n\nI've had some stomach issues, but nothing too severe, just a feeling of discomfort in my belly. \n\nTo be honest, I've been feeling pretty unwell lately, and the abdominal pain is just one of the many things that's been bothering me."

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've lost about 5.4 kilograms over the past month or so, and it's been pretty noticeable. I've had to let out my pants a few times because they're not fitting the way they used to."

    "text": "You mentioned the night sweats, can you describe them to me, are they frequent or just occasional?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "They're pretty frequent, actually. I'd say I wake up with night sweats almost every night. It's not just a little sweat, either - I'm talking drenched, like I've been running a marathon or something."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I haven't noticed any unusual rashes or lesions on my skin. But I do have to admit, I've been working with a lot of people on construction sites lately, and we've had some guys out sick with what looked like flu-like symptoms."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I'd like to check your abdomen again for any abnormalities, and I'd also like to examine your supraclavicular lymph node more closely. Can you please lean forward so I can get a better look at the lymph node?"
