    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I'm feeling a bit better than I was before I started coming to this clinic, but I still get these feelings that make me feel like I'm always on edge, like I'm waiting for something to happen. Sometimes I find myself moving around a lot, just to keep my mind occupied, I guess."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed that you seem a bit nervous, is there anything in particular that's causing you concern or anxiety about your health?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I feel like I'm always \"on\" and can't really relax, even when I'm sitting still. I've been trying to focus in class, but it's hard when my mind keeps wandering and I feel the urge to get up and move around."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your nervous demeanor, which can sometimes be a symptom of underlying anxiety or even a movement disorder. Can you tell me, have you noticed any involuntary movements, such as twitching or shaking, in your body?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I do get these tiny movements, but they're more like... I don't know, like my legs are restless, I guess. I find myself crossing and uncrossing them all the time, even when I'm sitting still. It's like my legs are trying to move, but they're not."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've noticed that you seem to be fidgeting with your hands a bit, can you tell me if that's something that's been going on for a while or if it's a new development?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, I've been doing that a lot lately. It's like my hands just keep moving on their own, even when I'm trying to focus on something."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "It's a relatively new development, I think it started about a week ago. I've also been having some trouble sleeping and I've been feeling a bit off balance, like my body is just a little bit wobbly."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've been having some trouble sleeping, yeah. I find myself lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and my mind just won't shut off. I'll get up and pace around the room, trying to calm down, but it doesn't seem to help."

  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I feel like I'm just going through the motions most of the time. I'll be doing something, like watching a movie or hanging out with friends, and I'll suddenly feel this urge to get up and leave. It's like I'm not really present in the moment or something."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, it's been a bit tough to focus in class lately. I'll be reading a chapter or listening to a lecture, and my mind will just start to wander. I'll find myself thinking about something completely unrelated, like what I'm going to eat for lunch or what I need to do later that day. It's like my brain just can't stay on track."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I've been feeling a bit more irritable than usual, but I don't know if that's related to anything in particular. I just feel like I'm short-tempered and get frustrated easily, even over little things."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "They seem to come and go, I'd say. Some days are worse than others. I'll be sitting in class or watching a movie, and it's like my hands just take over. But other days, I'll be sitting still for hours, and I don't even notice it."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Well, I've been in school for a while now, and exams can be pretty stressful. But I've always been a bit of a worrier, even when things are going well. My parents are always on my case about something, too."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, I've been getting these headaches pretty frequently. They're not super painful, but they're just kind of... there, you know? And I've been feeling pretty tired all the time, like I'm running on empty."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been feeling a bit numb in my fingers and toes, especially when I'm sitting still for a long time. It's like my hands and feet are just... asleep, I guess."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of the numbness and tingling sensation in your hands. Can you tell me if these sensations are constant or do they come and go throughout the day?"

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I've been eating a lot more than usual. I just feel like I'm always hungry, and I'll grab whatever is convenient. I've also noticed that I've gained a few pounds, but I don't really know if that's related to my symptoms or just because I'm eating more."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, and I started taking risperidone about two months ago. I've been feeling a bit better since then, but these symptoms are still going on."

    "text": "I've taken note of your medical history, can you tell me if you've had any family history of neurological or psychiatric conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or depression?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yeah, my mom has struggled with depression for a while now. She's been taking medication and seeing a therapist, but it's been a long process for her. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with what I'm experiencing, but I thought it was worth mentioning."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been feeling a bit unsteady on my feet lately. It's like my body is trying to balance itself, but it's not quite working out. I've been walking around my house, and I feel like I'm going to trip over my own feet."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your vivid dreams and nightmares. Have you experienced any hallucinations or hearing voices since the onset of these symptoms?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, I don't think so. I mean, I've had some weird moments where I feel like I'm hearing things, but it's never been like I'm actually hearing voices or anything. It's more like... I don't know, it's hard to explain. It's like my mind is just playing tricks on me, I guess."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Based on your symptoms, I've been trying to piece together a possible diagnosis. I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about the possibility of a psychiatric condition, but the presence of the movement disorder and the vivid dreams and nightmares are also raising some red flags.\n\nBefore I make a final decision, I'd like to request some test results to help confirm my suspicions. REQUEST TEST: Electroencephalogram (EEG)."
