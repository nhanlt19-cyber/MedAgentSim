There's also a family history of genetic disorders, but you haven't specified which ones. \n\nConsidering these factors, I'm going to take a closer look at the possibilities. \n\nI've reviewed the symptoms, but I still need to confirm a few things. I'm going to request some test results to help narrow down the diagnosis.\n\nREQUEST TEST: Chest X-Ray\n\nThis will give me a better idea of what's going on in the baby's lungs."
