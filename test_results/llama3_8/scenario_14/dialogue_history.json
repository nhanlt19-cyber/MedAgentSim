    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "The pain does come and go, but it's been getting worse over time. It's more constant at night when I'm trying to sleep. Can you describe the sensation of the pain - is it a sharp, stabbing pain, or more of a dull ache?"

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's more of a dull ache, but it can get sharp when I try to move my finger. It feels like it's throbbing."
