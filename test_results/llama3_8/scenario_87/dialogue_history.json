  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. To be honest, my main complaint is just this persistent fatigue that I just can't seem to shake off. It's like my body is just running out of energy, even when I'm doing simple tasks."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I haven't had any problems swallowing. I can eat and drink just fine, it's just that I've been feeling really tired and run down lately, and sometimes it feels like I'm just going through the motions."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I've been feeling a bit... sensitive, I suppose, when I have a bowel movement. It's not really pain, but more like a discomfort that's hard to explain."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "You've mentioned blood in your stool and changes in bowel movements. Have you experienced any difficulty starting or stopping urination?"

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, it's a general feeling of tiredness throughout the day. I feel like I'm running on empty, and no matter how much rest I get, I just can't seem to recharge. It's like my body is just not getting the energy it needs to function normally."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've written down your symptoms, but I still need to ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any muscle weakness or pain, particularly in your arms or legs?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",

  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, I've been feeling a bit weaker in my arms and legs lately, but I don't think it's noticeable to the point of wasting. I just feel like I'm not as strong as I used to be, and even simple tasks take a lot more effort than they should."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I don't think so. I was a retired engineer, so I didn't work with any hazardous materials. I just did my usual office work, and then later on, I did some consulting work, but nothing that would expose me to anything like that."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've asked all 20 questions, and I must say, I'm quite concerned about your symptoms. You've mentioned significant weight loss, changes in bowel movements, blood in your stool, and fatigue. Have you experienced any of these symptoms at the same time as a previous illness or cancer diagnosis in your family?"
