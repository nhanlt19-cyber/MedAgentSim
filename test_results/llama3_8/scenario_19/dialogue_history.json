  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's definitely more on one side. I'd say it's on the left side, actually. When I move my leg, the pain feels like it's traveling down that side."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I've noticed a bit of numbness in my left foot, it's hard to describe, but it feels kind of... disconnected. And as for getting better or worse, it's been pretty steady, but I think it might be a bit worse when I'm standing or putting weight on my left leg."

    "text": "It's a bit of a struggle, to be honest. When I try to stand up, it feels like my leg is going to give out on me. And when I walk, I have to be careful not to put too much weight on it or it feels like it's going to buckle."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Does the pain worsen with movement, such as bending or twisting, or does it feel more stable when you're still?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Definitely worsens with movement. Anytime I try to bend or twist, the pain shoots down my leg and makes it hard to stand up straight. Even just getting out of bed or rolling over in bed is painful."
  },

    "text": "Does the pain radiate down to your toes, or does it stop at the calf?"

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any numbness or weakness in your toes, specifically, and are you able to wiggle them for me?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, I can wiggle them, but it's a bit harder than usual. The big toe feels a bit numb, and it's harder to move than the other toes."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Have you experienced any bowel or bladder incontinence, or difficulty urinating since the pain started?"
  },

  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's a bit harder to lift my left foot than my right one. And when I do lift it, it feels like it's pulling my leg down, making the pain worse."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Can you tell me if you've had any numbness or tingling sensation in your left foot, and has it affected your ability to walk or stand on it?"
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "I've definitely noticed a tingling sensation in my left foot, it's hard to describe, but it feels like it's not quite connected to the rest of my body. And yes, it's definitely made it harder for me to walk or stand on it, I have to be really careful not to put too much weight on it or it feels like it's going to buckle."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "I've taken note of your symptoms, but I have to admit that I'm a bit concerned about the sudden onset of severe pain and the fact that it radiates down your leg. Have you recently had any kind of surgery or procedure that could have caused nerve damage?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I haven't had any surgery or procedures recently. I've been pretty healthy, like I said, just the usual gym routine."
  },

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Yes, I've noticed a bit of numbness in the back of my left leg, it's hard to describe, but it feels like a dead spot, and the pain seems to be radiating from that area."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Based on your symptoms, I have to consider a few possibilities, but I'm leaning towards a diagnosis that involves nerve compression. Before I make a final decision, I'd like to confirm a few things. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling sensation in the back of your left leg, specifically around the area where the pain is radiating from?"
