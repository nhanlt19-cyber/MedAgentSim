  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "About a month ago, I think. It started after I had a bit of a cold, but the cough and shortness of breath didn't really go away after I felt better."
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "About a month ago, I remember it started after I went on a hike with my family. I thought it was just allergies at first, but it's been getting worse."
  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It's been really bad at night, I wake up gasping for air sometimes. And it's not just at night, it gets worse when I'm doing things like climbing stairs or even just walking up a slight incline."

  },

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "It seems to get worse when I'm exerting myself, like when I'm walking up stairs or even just taking a short walk. I've noticed it's also worse when I'm lying down, which is weird because I'd think it would be better, but it's actually worse then too."

    "speaker": "Patient",

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I did notice that I got a bit winded pretty easily during the hike, but I just thought it was because I wasn't used to the altitude. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now that I think about it, it might have been a sign that something was off."

I've been trying to eat healthier, but that's more of a general goal of mine, not something I started doing specifically because of my symptoms. \n\nActually, I have noticed that I get a bit lightheaded when I stand up too quickly, which is something that's never happened to me before."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Actually, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling sensations in my hands or feet. But I have noticed that my legs feel a bit weak when I'm climbing stairs or walking uphill. It's not a complete weakness, but more like I'm getting tired more easily than usual."

I just drink plenty of water and try to pace myself to avoid getting too winded. \n\nI do try to drink more water when I'm at high elevations, but it doesn't seem to make a huge difference in how I feel. \n\nActually, it's been really hard for me to exercise or even do daily activities without feeling short of breath. It's like my body just can't get enough oxygen, even when I'm not exerting myself that much."

    "speaker": "Doctor",

I've taken note of your episodic cough and shortness of breath, which started after a hike, and your symptoms getting worse in cold air or at higher elevations. I've also noticed your wheezy breathing pattern, but you don't have a history of smoking or asthma.\n\nConsidering all the factors, I'm going to take a risk here and make a diagnosis. But keep in mind, I'm doing this with caution, especially given the recent case of cancer-like symptoms that was misdiagnosed.\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)"
