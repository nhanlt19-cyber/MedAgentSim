I'm not sure if it's the spice itself or just my stomach reacting to it, but I've noticed it makes my symptoms worse. As for the list of foods I've eaten in the past 24 hours, let me see... I had a bowl of oatmeal with sugar in the morning, a chicken stir-fry with some vegetables for lunch, and a pasta dish with tomato sauce for dinner. I also had some crackers and plain toast for a snack in between. I had a spicy tuna sandwich for lunch yesterday, and I remember feeling pretty uncomfortable after eating that. I've also been drinking a lot of water, probably around 12-15 glasses a day, to try and stay hydrated.\""

The medication you prescribed has helped to slow down the frequency of my bowel movements a bit, and I've been able to keep down some solid foods without having any accidents. However, I still feel pretty uncomfortable and tired, and I'm hoping we can figure out what's causing my symptoms and find a way to get me feeling better soon.\""
