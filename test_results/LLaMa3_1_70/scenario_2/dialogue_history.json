Yeah, his brother had some stomach issues when he was a kid, like I mentioned before. He had some vomiting and was really fussy, but it was just for a few days and then he was fine. I don't think it was anything serious, but it did make me worry a bit when I was pregnant with my son. I did talk to the doctor about it, and she just said it was probably just a normal phase of development, but I guess it's possible that it could be related to something more serious, like pyloric stenosis.\""

She explained that this surgery involves making an incision in the muscle around the pylorus to widen the opening and allow food to pass more easily. She said that the surgery is usually done under general anesthesia and can be performed laparoscopically or through an open incision. She also mentioned that the surgery is typically done in the first few weeks of life, and that the recovery process can take a few weeks. As for the risks and benefits, she said that the surgery is usually successful in relieving symptoms, but there's always a risk of complications, such as infection, bleeding, or nerve damage. She also mentioned that some babies may experience regurgitation or vomiting after the surgery, but that this is usually temporary.
