I've been doing a bit more yoga since I started feeling anxious about this mass, but I haven't noticed any significant changes in my overall health or weight recently.\n\nI have to say, doctor, I've been feeling a bit more self-conscious about my body since I noticed the mass.

When I touch it, it does feel a bit firm, but it's not hard or rock-like, it's more... dense, I suppose.
