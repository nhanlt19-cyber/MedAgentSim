As for my urine output, I'd say it's been a bit decreased since giving birth, I've had to urinate more frequently, but the amount of urine I'm producing seems to be less than usual. It's like my body is just not producing as much fluid as it should be, and it's making me feel really dehydrated.\""

The smell is a bit more unpleasant than what I'm used to, but it's not really overpowering. I've also noticed that the discharge is a bit more yellowish in color than usual, and it's been getting a bit thicker and more gelatinous.
