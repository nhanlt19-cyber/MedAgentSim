She started getting symptoms when she was in her 50s, which is pretty late for most people. As for ataxia symptoms, she didn't really experience any, but she has had some vision problems and numbness in her legs over the years. As for speech and swallowing, I don't think I've had any major issues with either, but I do get a bit slurred sometimes, especially after a long day or when I'm tired. And, yeah, eating can be a bit tricky sometimes - I'll trip over my own feet or spill food all over the place. I think it might be worse after a big meal, to be honest.\"\n\n\"I've also noticed that my speech can be a bit affected by my ataxia symptoms. Sometimes I'll say something and then realize I don't know what I meant to say, or I'll stumble over my words"

But if I'm drinking a thin liquid, like water or juice, I'm usually okay.
