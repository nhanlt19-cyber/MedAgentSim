I hadn't made the connection to the bleeding yet, but now that you've mentioned it, I think it might be related. I've also been feeling a bit more anxious and on edge, which is probably just stress, but it's been bothering me a bit."

It's not that it's severe or anything, but it's just that I've been having to go to the bathroom more often than I used to. As for the rectal area, like I said, the sensation of the mass seems to be a bit more manageable when I'm lying down or sleeping, but it's still there. It's just that I feel like it's not as prominent or uncomfortable when I'm in those positions."

It's hard to describe, but it feels like there's a bit more... pressure or resistance when I press on it, even though the mass itself feels smaller. As for the surrounding tissues, I haven't really noticed any changes, but I have felt a bit more... anxious or on edge, like there's something bothering me on a deeper level. It's hard to explain, but it's like my body is trying to tell me something, but I'm not sure what."
