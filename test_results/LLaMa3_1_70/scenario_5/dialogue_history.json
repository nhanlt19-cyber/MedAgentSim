And to be honest, it took me a bit longer than usual to start feeling more comfortable after I got out of bed. I think it was because I had to put weight on it and move around a bit, which seemed to loosen it up a bit.

It takes me about 20-30 minutes to get dressed and have a quick breakfast before I head out the door. As for the stiffness, it's usually pretty bad when I first wake up, but it starts to loosen up after about 10-15 minutes of movement. I find that doing some light stretching or taking a warm shower really helps to loosen it up and get the blood flowing. In fact, I was just thinking about that, and I realized that I've been doing some gentle knee bends and leg swings while I'm getting ready in the morning, which seems to help a bit. But the pain is still pretty intense, especially when I first stand up and start walking around.\""
