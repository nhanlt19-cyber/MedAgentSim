As for topical creams or ointments, I have tried applying an antibiotic cream to the area, but it hasn't seemed to help much. I did notice that it seemed to reduce the redness a bit, but the pain and discomfort persisted. I've also tried applying aloe vera gel, but that didn't seem to make much of a difference either.\""

When I'm standing or walking, the pain is more pronounced, but when I sit down or lie down, it eases up a bit. As for specific activities, I'd say that walking or standing for long periods makes the pain worse, but it seems to be manageable. However, when I'm doing activities that involve bending or twisting, like gardening or lifting, the pain gets a bit worse. It's like my leg is more sensitive to movement, especially when I'm putting pressure on the area around the lesion.\""

As for remedies, I've been trying to keep the area clean and dry, and I've been applying some antibiotic ointment, but like I said, it hasn't seemed to help much. I did notice that the pain seems to worsen when I take my insulin, though.

Applying pressure to the area makes the pain a bit worse, but it's still mostly a dull ache. I'd say it's more uncomfortable when I press on the skin near the lesion, and it feels like it's getting a bit more sensitive to the touch. The sensation is a bit hard to describe, but it's like the skin around the lesion is getting a bit more inflamed or irritated, and it's making me feel more uncomfortable.

I was visiting my niece's house and one of her cats, a big fluffy Persian, decided to swat at me with its paw. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now that I'm looking back, I'm wondering if it might be related to the lesion. As for changes in the lesion's appearance or pain after being around cats, I have to admit that I've noticed it seems to be getting a bit worse since I've been around them more. The pain is more pronounced, and the purplish borders seem to be getting more pronounced too. It's like the cat scratches might have triggered something, but I'm not sure what.\""
