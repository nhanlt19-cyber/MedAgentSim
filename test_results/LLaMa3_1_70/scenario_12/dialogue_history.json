Getting in and out of bed has been a bit of a challenge, but I've been managing to do it with the help of my family members. Taking a shower is okay, as long as I'm not bending down too much, and I've been trying to use a shower chair to take some of the pressure off.

When I'm not putting weight on my leg, the pain is still there, but it's a bit more manageable. It's like my leg is just numb and I can tolerate it a bit better."

    "text": "Yes, I have to be really careful about lifting and bending things, and I've had to modify my behavior a lot. For example, I have to lift groceries from the floor instead of bending down to pick them up, and I've had to switch to using a cart to carry heavy bags. It's really frustrating, but I know it's necessary to avoid putting too much strain on my right leg. I've also had to stop doing some of my favorite activities, like gardening or playing with my kids, because they require heavy lifting or bending. It's hard to adjust, but I'm trying to be more mindful of my body and take it easy when I need to."
