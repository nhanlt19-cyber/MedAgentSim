I've also noticed that I have to take more breaks throughout the day to rest my eyes and take a few deep breaths.

As for energy levels, I've noticed that after eating a meal that's high in sugar, like a dessert or a sugary drink, I tend to feel a bit more sluggish and tired afterwards.

Even simple tasks like holding onto a cup of coffee or typing on my keyboard feel like I'm using more strength than usual. It's not just the lifting or bending, but also the simple actions that feel like they're straining my muscles."

They're usually in my right arm and they feel like a sharp pain that shoots through my muscles. It's not too severe, but it's definitely noticeable and it can be a bit uncomfortable. As for my muscle tone, I think it's a bit weaker in my right arm compared to my left, especially when I'm trying to lift or carry things."

And when I'm active, I can feel them straining a bit more, like they're working harder to do the tasks I need them to do. It's not a huge difference, but it's noticeable."
