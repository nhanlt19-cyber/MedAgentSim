She also mentioned that my alkaline phosphatase levels were a bit higher than normal, but she didn't make a big deal out of it at the time. I think she just said it was a precautionary measure to rule out any underlying conditions that might be causing the elevation. I don't really remember the exact numbers, but I think my AST and ALT levels were around 200-250 units, and my alkaline phosphatase levels were around 300-350 units. She didn't seem too concerned about it, but I guess that's why she's bringing it up now.\""

We did a liver ultrasound, which showed some evidence of liver fibrosis and scarring, which could be related to your ulcerative colitis.
