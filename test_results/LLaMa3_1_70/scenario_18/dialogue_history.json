    "text": "\"Oh, doc, I think my last appointment was about two weeks ago, and Dr. Smith was being really reassuring about the baby's health. She said everything looked fine, and the baby was growing well. She did mention something about the placenta being 'well-vascularized', but I didn't really think much of it at the time. I mean, I was feeling pretty good about the pregnancy, and I didn't want to worry about anything. But now that I'm experiencing this...I'm not so sure. She did seem a bit concerned, but I think she just dismissed it as Braxton Hicks contractions. I remember saying something about feeling the baby move less than usual, but she just kind of waved it off and told me to keep an eye on it. I'm starting to wonder if she missed something, or if she just didn't think it was a big deal.\""

I didn't really like it, to be honest. After the exam, I felt a bit more pressure in my pelvis and vagina, like my cervix was starting to dilate or something. But I'm not sure if that's related to the bleeding and pain or just my imagination. It's all really confusing and scary.\""
