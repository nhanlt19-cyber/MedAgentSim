The fingernail discoloration and discoloration on your fingernails also suggest scabies, as it is a common symptom of this condition. \n\nI would like to request a follow-up appointment to discuss treatment options and provide you with a prescription for an effective scabies treatment. \n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Scabies"
