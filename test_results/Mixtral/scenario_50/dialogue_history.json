  },

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Well, doc, around that time, I did notice that I had some extra hair growth on my chin, which was a bit embarrassing for me. I also had some acne that was pretty severe, and I was getting these really bad breakouts."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, doc, I don't really remember experiencing any joint pain or fatigue back then. I just remember feeling a bit self-conscious about my acne and the hair growth on my chin, and it was really frustrating because I felt like I was different from my friends. I just tried to deal with it and hoped it would go away eventually."

    "text": "It's been a bit of a rollercoaster, to be honest. The acne has been really bad, especially during the times I was on oral isotretinoin. But it's been pretty manageable now that I'm on the oral contraceptive. As for the other physical changes, I've noticed that I have some... unusual growths, I guess you'd say, on my clitoris and labia. They've been there since birth, but they've just gotten a bit more noticeable as I've gotten older."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "So you said you've noticed other unusual physical changes. Can you tell me more about them? Are they related to your bones, such as any unusual breaks or fractures, or are they more about your joints or muscles?"
  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "To be honest, doc, I've had a pretty unusual history of fractures. I mean, I'm not talking about extreme trauma or anything, but I've broken bones just from minor stuff, like tripping over my own feet or falling off the couch. It's like my bones are really fragile or something."

As for my diet, I try to eat pretty healthily, but I do have a bit of a sweet tooth. I think I might have been eating more sugary snacks when I was younger, but I've been trying to cut back on that in recent years.\n\nAnd I do remember that my mom was pregnant when I was born, and she had some pretty weird hair growth on her chin during that time. I don't know if that's related to anything, but it's definitely stuck with me."

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "Honestly, doc, I tried to eat a balanced mix of foods, but I was pretty picky about what I ate. I had a lot of trouble digesting certain foods, especially if they were too spicy or had a lot of fiber. I think that might have been because I was always getting stomachaches, and I didn't know how to deal with them back then.\n\nAnd okay, doc, I'm ready for the physical examination. Please go ahead and assess my bone density and look for any other unusual features. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm also trying to be open and honest with you."

    "speaker": "Doctor",
    "text": "Can you show me the unusual physical features you've noticed since your menarche was delayed? Are they related to your face, hands, or any other parts of your body?\n\n\n\nAlso, during the physical examination, I'll be looking for any signs of osteoporosis, such as a loss of bone density in your hips or spine. Can you please remove your shoes and socks so I can inspect your feet and ankles?\n\n\n\nAlso, I'd like to know more about your family history. Do you have any close relatives who have experienced similar symptoms or have any known medical conditions?"

I'm a bit worried about what you'll find, but I'm trying to be open and honest.\n\nAs for my family history, my mom had some pretty unusual symptoms during pregnancy, like abnormal hair growth on her chin. And my mom's sister had some problems with her bones, I think it was something to do with her bones breaking easily too."
