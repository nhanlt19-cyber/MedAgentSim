You've experienced episodes of unresponsiveness and facial grimacing for about 6 months, triggered by activities that require concentration, and accompanied by an increase in heart rate and a drop in body temperature before and after the episodes. You've also noticed some physical sensations such as muscle weakness, tremors, and vision changes during these episodes.\n\n\n\nI've reviewed the test results, including the Electrocardiogram, Blood Chemistry Panel, Sleep Study, and Thyroid Function Test. All of these tests appear to be within normal limits.\n\n\n\nHowever, I do have some concerns about the physical examination. Your pupils reacted well to the light, but your facial grimacing during the examination did suggest some abnormal muscle tone.\n\n\n\nConsidering all of this information, I'm going to take a stab at making a diagnosis."
