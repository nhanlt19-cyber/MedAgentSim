I was sitting by a stream, and I swear I could hear the birds talking about their migration patterns and the location of food sources. It was like they were sharing a secret with me. But then, I saw a squirrel scurrying by, and I felt this sudden urge to know where it was going, and I could sense its excitement about finding an acorn. It was like I was eavesdropping on their conversations, but it felt so real."

I'd see a bird, and I'd hear its thoughts, and then I'd see a deer, and I'd sense its fear of being hunted.

    "text": "It's more pronounced when the weather is changing, like right now. I can feel the tension in the air, and it's like the animals are all reacting to it too.

It's overwhelming.\n\nAnd yeah, I've been taking all sorts of Peruvian herbs \u2013 ayahuasca, guarana, that kind of thing \u2013 trying to quiet my mind or something.
