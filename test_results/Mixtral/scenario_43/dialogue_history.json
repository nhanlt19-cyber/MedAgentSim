You've experienced sudden onset abdominal pain, particularly in the lower left quadrant, which is concerning for appendicitis. You've also reported changes in bowel movements, nausea, and fever. \n\nNow, let's review your test results. The Complete Blood Count revealed an elevated white blood cell count, which suggests an inflammatory response. The Electrolyte Level test showed a mild electrolyte imbalance, and the Urinalysis was normal. The Abdominal Ultrasound didn't reveal any significant abnormalities, but it did show some peritoneal fluid. The Blood Culture test is pending, but the initial results are inconclusive.\n\nConsidering your symptoms and test results, I'm inclined to believe that you may have appendicitis. However, I'd like to request a few more tests to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nPlease wait for a moment"
