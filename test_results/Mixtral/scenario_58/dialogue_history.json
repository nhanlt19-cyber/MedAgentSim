These factors can lead to heightened emotional states, irritability, and physical symptoms such as diaphoresis and tachycardia.\n\nYou've been under considerable stress with your exams, and the fact that you've been pulling all-nighters has likely exacerbated your physical and emotional state. Additionally, your increased appetite and sleep deprivation may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nRegarding recent changes or events in your life, you've mentioned that the stress from your exams has been intense and has snowballed over time. You've also been feeling anxious, irritable, and on edge, which could be related to your academic pressures.\n\nAs for recent stressors, it seems that your exams have been a significant source of stress. You may want to consider exploring ways to manage your stress levels, such as taking regular breaks, practicing relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends,"
