Usually, it happens when I've been working on my computer for a while or after I've been physically active, like when I'm trying to climb stairs, and it gets really bad. Sometimes it gets better after I rest for a few hours, but it's been really frustrating and scary."

I don't feel any numbness or tingling, it's just that my arms feel heavy and I get tired quickly, but like I said, it gets better after I rest for a bit."

    "speaker": "Doctor",

  },
  {
    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "The difficulty climbing stairs is not just because of my arm weakness, I also feel like my legs get tired easily and it's hard to lift them up to take the next step.

And as for family history, I don't think so, my parents are healthy and I don't have any siblings with neurological disorders. I've just been feeling really frustrated with these symptoms, they're affecting my work and daily life, and I'm worried about what could be causing them."

As for pain or discomfort, I wouldn't say it's exactly pain, but my muscles feel really tired and achy, especially after I've been active, and it takes a while for them to recover."

    "speaker": "Patient",
