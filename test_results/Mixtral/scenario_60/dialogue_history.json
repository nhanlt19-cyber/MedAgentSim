This condition is often associated with fungal or bacterial infections of the external ear canal. The discharge you've described, which appears to be watery and may be accompanied by some odor, is consistent with this diagnosis. Given your recent tympanoplasty, I'm also considering the possibility of post-operative complications, such as chronic otitis externa.
