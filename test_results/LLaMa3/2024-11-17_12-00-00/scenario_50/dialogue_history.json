It can cause a range of symptoms, including delayed puberty, short stature, and bone fragility.\n\nI'd like to confirm this diagnosis with a review of your test results, specifically the results from the Bone Density X-Ray, Vitamin D Level, Thyroid Function Test, Complete Blood Count, and the Ultrasound of the Pelvis.
