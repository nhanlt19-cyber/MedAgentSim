The longer I hold onto something, the more my arm starts to ache and feel like it's going to give out on me. Heat doesn't really seem to help, but I do find that taking a break and stretching it out a bit can make it feel a little better for a short time.\n\nAnd yeah, sure, I'll lift my arm for you. *places right arm behind back and lifts it slightly*"
