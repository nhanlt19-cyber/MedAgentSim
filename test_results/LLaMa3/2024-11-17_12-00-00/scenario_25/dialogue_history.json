The circular patch on your forearm is likely a skin lesion known as a cholestasis pruritus plaque, which is a characteristic feature of this condition. \n\nI also suspect that you may have a parasitic infection, possibly caused by a liver fluke such as Clonorchis sinensis or Fasciola hepatica. The stool test results may reveal evidence of gastrointestinal parasites. \n\nAdditionally, your symptoms are also consistent with a condition known as Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune liver disease that can cause cholestasis and liver damage.
