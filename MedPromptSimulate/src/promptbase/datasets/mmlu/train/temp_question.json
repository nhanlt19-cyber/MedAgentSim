A newborn presents with a few days of an erythematous maculopapular rash with pustules on the trunk and extremities, sparing the palms and soles, associated with mild fussiness but no other significant symptoms such as fever, sneezing, or runny nose. The symptoms have been relatively stable since onset, without clear triggers for worsening or improvement. Laboratory results show normal complete blood count, blood culture, stool culture, urine culture, viral panel, immunoglobulin levels, and biopsy. Imaging, including chest X-ray, revealed no abnormalities. Given the comprehensive testing with normal results and the characteristic presentation of the rash, what is the final diagnosis for this patient?",
