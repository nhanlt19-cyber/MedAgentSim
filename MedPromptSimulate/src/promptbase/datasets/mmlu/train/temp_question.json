        "question": "Provide the most likely final diagnosis for the following patient. A [unknown] year old [man/woman] presents with a progressive course of double vision, associated with upper limb weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, balance issues, and fine motor movement difficulties. The symptoms have been worsening over time, with the upper limb weakness and double vision becoming more pronounced, but the exact triggers and relieving factors are not clearly identified. Laboratory results are pending, including an electromyography (EMG) test to evaluate muscle function and identify potential nerve damage. Imaging studies, including a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, have been requested to rule out structural abnormalities such as tumors, multiple sclerosis, or stroke. Given the combination of motor symptoms, including muscle weakness, potential numbness or tingling, and double vision, without clear indications of a systemic illness or infection, and considering the progressive nature of the symptoms, what is the final diagnosis for this patient?",
