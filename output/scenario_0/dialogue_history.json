    "text": "It's not constant, it comes and goes, usually after I've been working on my computer for a while or doing something active. Sometimes I notice that my eyes have a hard time focusing on one thing, and it's like I'm seeing two images at the same time, but if I take a break and rest for a bit, it seems to get better."

    "speaker": "Patient",
    "text": "No, I haven't had any recent trauma or head injuries, and I don't have any previous conditions that I'm aware of. As for climbing stairs, it's mainly due to weakness, especially in my arms and legs, it feels like they get tired easily and I have to make a lot of effort to lift my legs up to the next step."

    "text": "It's affecting both arms, and I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling, but sometimes I feel a bit of discomfort or heaviness in my muscles, especially after I've been using them for a while. The weakness started about a month ago, around the same time I began experiencing double vision, and it seems to be getting worse with physical activity, but like I mentioned before, it improves after I rest."

As for fatigue, muscle cramps, or fasciculations, I do feel fatigued, especially after physical activity, and sometimes I get muscle cramps in my arms, but I'm not sure about fasciculations. My symptoms seem to be getting worse over time, especially with physical activity, but like I said, they do improve with rest, so it's a bit unpredictable."

It's not really worse in the morning, but more so after I've been using my arms and hands for a while, and like I mentioned before, it improves after I rest for a bit."

As for daily activities, I've had to modify them a bit, like taking more breaks when I'm working on my computer or doing tasks that require a lot of arm movement, and I've also had to find ways to make climbing stairs easier, like holding onto the railing for support.

I don't really experience dizziness or lightheadedness, it's more like my legs just feel weak and I have to concentrate on each step to make sure I don't stumble.

I haven't really changed my diet or exercise routine recently, so I don't think that's contributing to my symptoms. As for sleep, I usually get around 7-8 hours a night, which seems to be enough for me. I haven't traveled recently or been exposed to anyone with a similar illness, and I'm not taking any medications or supplements that I think could be causing my symptoms, just a multivitamin occasionally."

I haven't really noticed any correlation between my sleep and the severity of my symptoms, like double vision or upper limb weakness, but I do feel like I need to take naps during the day sometimes because I get so fatigued. I wouldn't say I have insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness, it's just that my body feels like it needs more rest than it used to."

As for fine motor movements, I have noticed that it's a bit harder for me to do things like buttoning a shirt or tying my shoes, especially after I've been using my hands for a while, it's like my fingers just don't want to cooperate. Activities that seem to make my symptoms worse are things like lifting heavy objects, carrying groceries, or even just brushing my hair, anything that requires a lot of arm movement or strength seems to exacerbate the weakness and double vision."

    "text": "Yes, the difficulty with fine motor movements is definitely affecting my daily activities, like I mentioned earlier, things like buttoning a shirt or tying my shoes are becoming more challenging for me. I've noticed that when I'm at rest, my symptoms seem to improve, but as soon as I start doing something active, like cooking or cleaning, the weakness and double vision come back. It's like my body can only handle so much activity before it starts to feel overwhelmed and my symptoms worsen."

As for my double vision, I have noticed that it's worse when I'm looking at things that are far away, like when I'm watching TV or trying to read a sign on the street. It's also worse when I'm looking to the side, like when I'm trying to see something out of the corner of my eye. But when I'm looking at things that are close up, like my phone or a book, the double vision seems to be a bit better."

    "text": "Yes, I have noticed some weakness and fatigue in my lower limbs, especially after I've been walking or standing for a while. As for difficulty with walking or balance, I do feel a bit unsteady at times, but it's not just related to climbing stairs, I've also noticed it when I'm walking on flat surfaces. It's hard to explain, but it's like my legs just feel heavy and I have to concentrate on each step to make sure I don't stumble. As for specific times of the day when my symptoms are worse, I'd say it's usually after I've been active for a few hours, like in the afternoon or early evening, that's when I tend to feel the most fatigued and my symptoms seem to be at their worst."

Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder, typically presenting with abdominal pain, fever, and potentially jaundice, which does not align with the neurological symptoms described.\n\nBased on the symptoms presented, including double vision, upper limb weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, fine motor movement difficulties, and the discussion among the doctors considering conditions such as multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy, and peripheral neuropathy, a more appropriate diagnosis would be a neurological disorder.\n\nGiven the combination of motor symptoms (upper limb weakness, difficulty climbing stairs), potential sensory or balance issues (double vision, difficulty with fine motor movements), and the absence of clear indications of a systemic illness or infection, the most likely diagnosis would be a condition affecting the nervous system, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or another"
